<p>
To get started with RMS fitting and alignment, 
open the RMSD item from the <b>Extensions</b> menu.
You should now have a new window titled RMSD Tool
We'll describe the RMSD calculator function first.

<h3>RMSD calculation</h3>

<img src="rmsd_extension.png">

<p>
The RMSD calculator button is used to calculate RMS distances between molecules.
The upper left corner of the menu is where you specify which atoms are to be
used in the calculation.  In the input field, type the atom selection text
just as you would in the Graphics form.  The checkbox below the input field
entitled <i>Backbone only</i> restricts whatever atom selection you typed to just
the backbone atoms of the selection; in effect, it adds "and backbone" to the
atom selection text. 

<p>
The upper right corner of the menu has a button labeled <b>RMSD</b>.  Its effect
depends on which of the <b>Top</b>, <b>Average</b>, or
<b>Selected</b> radio buttons are selected.
If <b>Top</b> is selected, VMD calculates the RMS distance between the top 
molecule (which is usually the last molecule loaded) and every other molecule.
If <b>Average</b> is selected, VMD first computes the average x, y, z 
coordinates of the selected atoms in each molecule, then computes the 
RMS distance of each molecule from that average structure.

<p>
Results of the RMS calculations for each molecule are shown in the browser in 
the bottom half of the menu.  Note that this list is not updated until you
presse the RMSD button, so the effects of loading/deleting molecules will 
not be immediately reflected.  The <b>Total RMSD</b> label at the bottom of the
menu shows the average RMSD for all molecules listed.

<p>
<h3>RMS Alignment</a>
</h3>

<p>
The RMS Alignment button fits molecules based on selected groups of atoms.
Whereas the RMSD calculator button finds the RMS distance between molecules 
without disturbing their coordinates, the RMS Alignment button actually moves 
molecules to new positions.

</p><p>
This button is quite simple: Enter an atom selection in the input field, and 
press Align to align the molecules based on the atoms in that selection.
If you recompute the RMSD between molecules with the RMSD calculator button, 
you will probably find that the values are different; this is because the 
calculation is made based on the current positions of the atoms.

    <p>The CloneRep plugin provides functionality to 'clone' the full
      set of representations from one molecule onto another. 
      All previously existing visualizations are deleted. It
      also comes with a small GUI to perform the task without
      having to use the command line.</p> 

    <h3>Text mode Interface:</h3>
    <p>The package is loaded by:<p>
    <p><tt>package require clonerep</tt></p>
    <p>and exports the tcl procedure 
     <tt>::CloneRep::clone_reps [<it>&gt;fromid&lt;</it>]
         [<it>&gt;toid&lt;</it>]</tt>
     for cloning representations. The <it>fromid</it> designates
     the molecule id from where the list of representations is taken
     from and <it>toid</it> the molecule id(s) where it is copied to.
     For the source also the symbolic value <it>top</it> is supported,
     representing the current top molecule, and for the target the 
     symbolic entries, <it>all</it>, <it>active</it>, and <it>displayed</it>
     are available, representing all molecules or those with the corresponding
     status (excluding the source molecule id).
     When no arguments are provided they default to <it>top</it> 
     and <it>all</it>, respectively.
     </p>
    
    <h3>Graphical Interface:</h3>
    <p>The graphical user interface has two pop-up lists that
      allow selecting the two molecule ids needed for the clone_reps
      command and the <tt>Clone</tt> button to execute the text mode script.</p>

    Support for symbolic molecule ids based on a patch by Luis Gracia.</p>

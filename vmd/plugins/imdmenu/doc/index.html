The IMDMenu plugin replaces the functionality of the "simulation" 
menu item found in many of the older versions of VMD.  The advantage
of implementing in a plugin is that it can easily be extended to provide
monitoring of various additional simulation status variables, or other
interesting data, without the need to recompile VMD itself.

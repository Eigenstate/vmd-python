Changes in v2.7
---------------

* Added function "writexst".
* Improved docs.

Changes in v2.6
---------------

* Added option "pbc join connected".
* Added a "-material" flag to "pbc box"
* Added a "-bondlist|-nobondlist" flag of "pbc join" that selects an
  alternate, bond-topology based algorithm, that works better with
  long chains. 

Changes in v2.5
---------------

* Added option "-border" to "pbc join" that allows to specify how deep
  in the system broken compounds can be found.
* Thanks to Dan Lussier and John Stone, join was optimized for a
  performance gain of about 50% and a massive reduction of the memory
  footprint.
* Thanks to Jan Saam, wrap and box are able to center the box on the
  center of mass of a selection. Added option "-centersel", added
  arguments "com" and "bb" to option "-center". Note, that "-center
  $sel" is deprecated.
* Thanks to Axel Kohlmeyer, join now checks whether the pbc cell
  parameters are reasonable.
* Automatically generate HTML docs from the LaTeX docs.

Changes in v2.4
---------------

* Added option "-noverbose" to wrap, unwrap and join for completeness.
* Translated documentation to LaTeX format to allow the distribution
  of the docs together with the plugin.
* Moved plugin to http://www.espresso-pp.de/projects/pbctools/ .

Changes in v2.3
---------------

* Bugfix (Thanks to Chris Maffeo!) of "pbc wrap -compound segment".
* Improved implementation of "pbc join -compound bonded", that uses
  VMDs "fragment" keyword now.
* Renamed "-rectangular" option of "pbc box" and "pbc wrap" to
  "-orthorhombic" (Translation hint thanks to Jon Halverson).

Changes in v2.2
---------------

* Docfixes.
* Changed default compound option of "pbc wrap" to "-nocompound".

Changes in v2.1
---------------

* Added "pbc join".

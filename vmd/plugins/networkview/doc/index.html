<H2>NetworkView</H2>

The NetworkView plugin allows the user to study allostery and signaling through
network models.  It can be used to display and manipulate representations of the
networks projected onto the underlying molecular structures.  Networks stored in
simple formats can be loaded and mapped onto molecular structures. 

<P>
The Luthey-Schulten Group has developed a detailed tutorial that demonstrates
the use of the NetworkView plugin.

Please go to the following URL and download the tutorial near the bottom of the
page entitled:  Dynamical Network Analysis.

<P> 
The simplest networks consist of sets of nodes and edges that connect pairs
of nodes. For example, in protein·protein interaction networks, nodes represent
individual proteins, and if two proteins interact with one another, an edge is
drawn between their nodes.

<H3>Dynamical Network Representations</H3>
<P>


The NetworkView plugin can display dynamical network representations by loading
a network file via <CODE>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Load&nbsp;Network...</CODE>.  Once the network is
loaded, you can choose to perform "Action"s on the network (or subnetworks,
defined by the choices made in the <CODE>Node&nbsp;Selection</CODE> section of the
plugin), listed in the box at the bottom of the plugin window.  Chose your
desired action and then click <CODE>Apply</CODE>.  You can perform multiple
Actions, and when you want to actually view the results, click the
<CODE>Draw</CODE> button at the bottom of the plugin window.

<H3>Communities</H3>

Community Data can be loaded into the NetworkView plugin by selecting 
<CODE>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Load&nbsp;Community&nbsp;Data...</CODE>.  You can then
use the <CODE>Node&nbsp;Selection</CODE> section of the plugin to choose individual communities to
perform Actions upon.

<P>
Critical nodes between communities can be displayed by choosing the proper
<CODE>Node&nbsp;Selection</CODE>.

<H3>Optimal and Suboptimal Paths</H3>

Optimal and Suboptimal paths can be loaded into the plugin and mapped onto
molecular structures.  You can choose to view all paths, or specific paths via
the <CODE>Node&nbsp;Selection</CODE>.

<H3>Advanced Features</H3>

Via TCL scripting, you can perform more complex operations than are exposed via
the plugin window.  See the tutorial for additional information on e.g.,
retrieving specific information about edges that connect subnetworks and other
metrics.

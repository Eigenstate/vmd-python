      The DipWatch plugin provides functionality to monitor dipole
      moments of molecules or parts thereof via the VMD atom selection
      syntax. It provides a GUI to manage up to six dipoles and allows
      to set several aspects of them.</p> 

    <p>DipWatch uses the charge information stored internally
      in VMD when you load a supported topology file or load
      charge information from a script. The actual computation
      of the dipole moment is delegated to the 'measure dipole'
      command, and the position of the center of the dipole is
      determined via 'measure center'.</p>


<h3>Graphical Interface:</h3>

    
    <p><img alt="DipWatch Screenshot" src="dipwatch_screen_small.png" style="width: 320px; height: 256px;" align="right">
      The graphical user interface consists of a table where each row
      contains the settings for one dipole representation. The checkbutton
      in the first column allows to en- or disable the representation.
      The subsequent columns allow selection of the molecule id, 
      atom selection string, atom selection update,
      color, scaling factor or the arrow length
      and its radius. If you change any of the fields, the display
      should be updated as soon as the focus changes or a button is
      pressed.</p>

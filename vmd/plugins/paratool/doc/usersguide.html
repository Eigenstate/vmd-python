<h1>Paratool User's Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Paratool provides a graphical interface for force field parametrizations of
molecules that are not contained in your force field. It is designed
to generate CHARMM compliant parameters, while it is also possible to
adhere to the AMBER protocol. Note that the recommended tool for AMBER
parameters is 
<a href="http://amber.scripps.edu/antechamber/antechamber.html">Antechamber</a>,
a collection of commandline programs that can (among other things)
find missing AMBER force field parameters .
<p>
The plugin helps you to generate the molecule or the moleular fragment
that should be parametrized and to set up the necessary
quantumchemical calculations (you'll need Gaussian, later versions
will also support GAMESS). 
Paratool reads the logfiles of the QM simulations, computes force
field parameters for bonds, angles dihedrals and impropers by
transforming the Hessian into internal coordinates and converting all
values into units based on kcal/mol, &Aring; and degrees. You can
assign atom types and the corresponding VDW parameters from a list of
already existing types or generates new types (all chemical elements
H - Rn supported). The charges can be determined using restricted
electrostatic potential fitting RESP (AMBER style) or CHARMM style
charges using their supramolecular approach which requires another
Gaussian calculation.
<p>
Paratool generates input for all necessary external programs collects
and compiles all the necessary data, organizes and displays them
neatly in lists and projects them onto your molecule in VMD. Finally 
it will write the topology and parameter files you'll need to build
the molecule using psfgen and run your simulation in your favourite
simulation package, e.g. NAMD.

<h3>Outline of the Parametrization Scheme</h3>
In the following it will be assumed that you are familiar with
the parametrization scheme of your favourite force field. It is highly
recommended that you read the original publications <a
href="#BESL98">[1-4]</a>. You can refresh your memory about the <a
href="general_scheme.html">differences in the general parametrization
scheme in CHARMM and AMBER here</a>. Another worthwile reading is <a
href="#MACK2004">[5]</a> and the <a
href="http://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/faculty/amackere/force_fields.htm"> 
tutorials found here</a> and 
<a href="http://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/faculty/amackere/param/force_field_dev.htm">
here</a>. <b>An absolute must-read is <a
href="http://www.psc.edu/general/software/packages/charmm/tutorial/mackerell/PARAM_00.pdf">
Alex Mackerell's parameter development tutorial</a>!</b> 
<p>
Parametrizing a novel component requires the following steps
which will be explained in detail further below: First a molecular
model compound containing unparametrized parts has to be defined. Then
the atom type and its according VDW parameters have to be chosen for
each atom from a list of existing atom types of the selected force
field. Further, all transferable parameters from the existing force
field have to be assigned to the model. If missing parameters remain
then these will be determined <i>de novo</i>. In that case the model
compound is the starting point for a quantumchemical geometry
optimization. A QM frequency calculation based on the optimized
geometry yields the Hessian matrix which can be transformed into the
set of internal coordinates describing the bonded interactions. The
diagonal elements of this internal Hessian denote the force constants
related to these coordinates. The basis for the charges is obtained
from a QM single point calculation from which Mulliken charges,
natural population analysis (NPA) charges <a href="#REED85">[7]</a>
and an electrostatic potential (ESP) charge fit <a
href="#BESL98">[1,8]</a> can be extracted. These raw data can
subsequently be used to compute the CHARMM type charges according to
the supramolecular approach or to setup a restricted electrostatic
potential fit (RESP). Subsequently, the parameters should be refined
in order to account for the implicit double accounting of
electrostatics in 1-4 interactions. Finally the new parameters must be
tested in a molecular dynamics simulation. 

<h3>Limitations</h3>
Force fields that are desiged for a wide range of purposes covering
many different molecular entities like CHARMM and AMBER must be
parametrized in a very thorough manner and with great care following a
coherent protocol. For the parametrization of additional compounds one
might deviate from these protocols but one should always keep in mind
that the quality of the results can depend on the consistency with
the other force field parameters. Thus a few important aspects of the
parametrization strategy of CHARMM and AMBER will be metioned. For a
complete discussion we refer the reader to the original publications
<a href="#BESL98">[1-4]</a>.
<p>
The current version of Paratool only considers quantum chemical target
data such as equilibrium geometry, vibrational frequencies,
electrostatic field and dipole moment. Nevertheless, you can manually
replace the quantum chemical equilibrium geometries and force
constants for bonds, angles, dihedrals and impropers by experimental
values.
<p>
Paratool does not yet implement the aforementioned automatic
selfconsistent iterative fitting against these data but you can of
course manually loop through several cycles of refinement and
hand-tune the data any time. Though in many cases the first iteration will
already yield satisfactory results.

<h2>How to parametrize a new molecule in PARATOOL</h2>
The very first thing you should do is visiting <a
href="http://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/faculty/amackere/force_fields.htm">
Alex Mackerell's website</a> and getting the latest CHARMM force
field. Inspect the topology files and see if your molecule has been
parametrized already. Paratool offers default top/par files
<code>top_all27_prot_lipid_na.inp</code> and
<code>par_all27_prot_lipid_na.inp</code> containing amino acids,
nucleic acids, lipids and a few other common compounds. But there's
more to find in the CHARMM files. Especially take a look at the file
for the model compounds <code>top_all22_model.inp</code>.

<h3>Defining a model compound</h3>
While you're inspecting the molecules of the existing force field
you'll most likely notice that some moieties of your molecule are the
same as in one of the already parametrized molecules. We'll make use
of that fact. The CHARMM and AMBER force fields are both designed for
an additive approach. They consist of molecular building blocks, so
called model compounds which can be combined into form bigger
units. I.e. the parameters are meant to be transferable to similar 
molecules. For instance take a look at aspartate:

It is stitched together from two smaller model compounds acetate and glycine (found in
<code>top_all22_model.inp</code> and <code>top_all27_prot_lipid.inp</code>) where H2 and HA2 are removed and C1 and CA are connected by a bond (C1 then become CB in the new compound etc.)
The charges of the two removed hydrogens were simply added to their mother atoms.

But where do the parameters for the peptide bonds that are formed when 
the multiple residues are joined in a polypeptide come from? 
They were obtained from the model compound N-methylacetamide. For CR

If one combines two NMA molecules the in the same manner we merged GLY 
and ACET we obtain a model compound with two peptice bonds. Clipping out the middle amino acid at the 
peptide bonds yields GLY as seen above.

Try to split your molecule into fragments that are parametrized
already! This saves a lot of time, you might end up with a much
smaller and simpler molecule to parametrize which you then combine
with the other pieces. This is also makes your parameters more
CHARMM compliant. Unfortunately Paratool does not yet support
automatic combining of model compounds so you'll have to do that last
step manually.

One thing has to be kept in mind when selecting the model
compounds. When they are combined then parameters spanning the linkage
like the link bond and the involved angles have to be present,
too. However in most cases these links are something simple like a
bond between two unpolar sp3 hybridized carbons for which numerous
templates exist.

<h3>Preparing a model compound (base molecule)</h3>
<a href="paratool_main.png"><img src="paratool_main_small.png" align="right"></a>
To begin a new Paratool project you can simply start Paratool from the
Tkcon command line or from the Extensions Menu in VMD's Main window.
In the GUI that pops up (see fig. 1), you'll see entries for IDs and file names for
4 different molecules. The ID is the same as in the VMD Main window.
The molecular model compound to which all further work will be related
and into which all data will be displayed is the "base molecule". You
can load it using the File menu. In the file open dialog you can
choose between different file types. PDB is the default. XBGF is an
internal file format derived from "biograf". It is similar to the PDB
format, but is able to store additional info such as atom types, VDW
parameters and partial charges. 
<p>
Throughout the parametrization process a quantum mechanically (QM) optimized
structure of the base molecule and a QM single point calculation will
be generated. They'll populate the last two entries.
<p>
The parent molecule is the molecule embedding the base molecule,
e.g. the protein containing a nonstandard aminoacid or an organic
substrate. The parent molecule is actually only needed if there are 
covalent bonds or coordination complex bonds (e.g. metal complexes
or iron-sulfur clusters) exist between the unparametrized part and
the rest of the molecule. In this case the size of the environment
which is added to the base molecule can be controlled interactively
using the entry labelled with "Selection of atoms from parent
molecule:" in the Paratool Main window. The parent molecule is set
automatically if you start Paratool using <a
href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/autopsf/">
AutoPSF</a>.
<p>
While it is probably a good idea to prepare the model compound
beforehannd in your favourite molecule editor you can also edit your
base molecule on the fly using VMD's built in editor   
<a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molefacture">
Molefacture</a>. You can for example cap open valences where covalent
bonds were chopped or delete atom groups that you want to parametrize
separately. I'll repeat myself here: Generally you should try to split
larger molecules into smaller fragments and parametrize these
separately. You can save a lot of CPU time during the quantumchemical
calculations and if the fragments are chosen properly you can generate
transferable parameters for molecular building blocks. The CHARMM and
AMBER force fields are both designed for this additive approach. These
model compounds can finally be combined to real molecules again.
<p>
Note that whenever you change the selection of the base molecule or
you modify it using Molefacture the previous base molecule will be
deleted and a new one generated and loaded. Thus the molecule ID will
not stay the same.

<h3>Editing atom properties</h3>
<a href="paratool_atomedit.png"><img src="paratool_atomedit_small.png" align="right"></a>
Now that your model compound has been determined, you can already set
many atom based properties. Use "Edit->Atom properties" to open the
appropriate interface. You'll see a list of properties for each atom
from which you can select single or multiple atoms to edit them using
the entry fields at the bottom of the window. There are three ways of
selecting atoms. 1) You can directly click on atoms in the OpenGL
window, the atom becomes marked with an orange sphere and seleccted in
the listbox. Holding the shift key while picking adds the atom to the
selection rather that replacing it. 2) You can select atoms from the
list using the mouse or the arrow keys. Dragging or shift selects
contiguous groups from the list, holding the control key allows to
select arbitrary atoms. 3) You can use VMD's atom selection language.
<p>
The first property you want to set is the residue name (Rname). Select
all atoms and type a name in the adequate field, confirming with
"Submit". Make sure that the residue name is unique among the topology
files you are planning to use. 
The residue number (Resid) and the segment ID (Segid) are only
relevant for transition metal complexes and iron-sulfur clusters but
they must be identical for all atoms of a model compound. 
If you are unhappy with the default atom names from you can change
them but each name must be unique in a residue. Also note that atom
names and the aforementioned strings should be in capital letters.
 
<h4>Assign atom types and VDW parameters</h4>
<a href="paratool_choosetype.png"><img src="paratool_choosetype_small.png" align="right"></a>
Next you have to choose the atom types. They describe a combination of
periodic element and chemical environment. Thus equivalent atoms such
as hydrogens in methyl groups of carboxylate oxygen have the same
type. In simulations the parameters for all bonded and VDW
interactions are looked up by the atom types.
The user can choose types and VDW parameters from a list of atom types
of the same chemical element existing in the current force field,
i.e. that occur in the loaded parameter files. You'll get there
pressing the "Choose type" button in the "Edit atom properties"
window. It is up to you to decide which given atom type matches the
chemical properties of the selected atom best. If you want these VDW
params but need a different type, you can simply rename it. For
elements that are not contained in the force field there are at the
bottom of the list atom types from the Universal Force Field (UFF)
<a href="#RAPP92">[6]<a/>. This asserts that there are VDW params for
each chemical element from H-Rn. These will also be chosen when you
autoassign VDW parameters from the "Edit" menu. 

Here's a simple guideline for the assignments:
Try to find an equivalent existing type of the same chemical element,
Paratool lets you pick that from a list. Many of the types for a certain
element have the same VDW params, e.g. CD and CC.
<pre>
C      0.000000  -0.110000     2.000000 ! ALLOW   PEP POL ARO
                ! NMA pure solvent, adm jr., 3/3/93
CA     0.000000  -0.070000     1.992400 ! ALLOW   ARO
                ! benzene (JES)
CC     0.000000  -0.070000     2.000000 ! ALLOW   PEP POL ARO
                ! adm jr. 3/3/92, acetic acid heat of solvation
CD     0.000000  -0.070000     2.000000 ! ALLOW  POL
                ! adm jr. 3/19/92, acetate a.i. and dH of solvation
</pre>
The reason why there are two types is that they are used in different
contexts so that you can for instance distinguish dihedrals including CC
or CD.

Which type to use has to be decided using chemical insight. Just try to
find the most similar atomtype by comparing structures where it appears.
Factors influencing this similarity are for example hybridization state,
polarization, same neighboring atoms.

Always try to use an existing atom type, unless you end up with bonded
parameters that are not equivalent enough. In the latter case you just
change the type name, but keeping the VDW params. In case there is no type
for the atom's chemical element you can use VDW parameters from the
Universal Force Field (they are at the end of the list). You can of course
change the predefined typename if you want.

Assinging types implies the automatic assignment of bonded parameters for
which all types are known and for which a matching entry could be found in
the currently loaded parameter files.

<h3>Assigning bonded parameters</h3>
<h4>Choosing internal coordinates</h4>
<a href="paratool_intcoor.png"><img src="paratool_intcoor_small.png"
align="right"></a>
Before bonded parameters can be assigned it has to be specified for
which internal coordinates, i.e. bonds, angles, dihedrals and
impropers bonded interactions must be determined. For each of these
coordinates parameters for bonded interaction will either be taken from
existing model compounds, or, in case no equivalent exists, be derived
from the Hessian matrix (see below). "Edit->Intenal coordinates" opens
a window containing a (initially empty) list of defined internal coordinates
and a plethora of buttons. A good starting point is to autogenerate the
internal coordinates. In this procedure all covalent bonds of a
molecule (as displayed in VMD) are defined as bonds. Then all possible
angles and dihedrals that can be constructed from the given bonds are
generated. In many cases this is already sufficient but you can add
and delete arbitrary coordinates. You can for example add impropers to
stabilize planar geometries. More info about the choice of internal
coordinates can be found <a href="intcoor_info.html">here</a>.
Note: After you have generated internal coordinates you can already write
valid topology files using the accordant button in the main window.
<p>
<h4>Finding equivalent parameters</h4>
As it was mentioned above already paratool tries to find known
parameters automatically based on the type names. Assume you
assign the type known CT3 to an atom then the according VDW params are
already set automatically. But if you then assign the also known type
CT2 to a neighboring atom then the CT3-CT2 parameters can be determind
and are assigned to that bond. Similar things happen with angles and
dihedrals if you continue assigning known atom types. 
By the way, in case the given <u>atom name</u> is found in the
topology of the given resname then we assume that we are using this
RESI as a template and the correct type, VDW params and even the
charge are assigned.
<p>
We can make even more use of the existing force field through
<i>parametrization by analogy</i>. In other words we are utilizing
parameters of parts that have a similar chemical environment. You must
decide what is chemically equivalent using your chemical
insight. Among the properties you should compare are periodic
elementss of the involved atoms, charges, bond orders and polarity of
bonds. This technique has been applied a lot within the force field
already. This is the reason why you find so many identical parameter
entries. Here's an example:
<pre>
CT1  CC    200.000     1.5220 ! ALLOW   POL
CT2  CC    200.000     1.5220 ! ALLOW   POL
CT3  CC    200.000     1.5220 ! ALLOW   POL
</pre>
Only the type names of the involved atoms differ but the
chemical nature of this bond is considered the same. The different type
names were needed to distinguish other properties like angles or dihedrals.
<p>


<h3>QM geometry optimization</h3>
<a href="paratool_qmopt.png"><img src="paratool_qmopt_small.png"
align="right"></a>
For the calculation of partial charges and the parameters for bonded
interactions we need the QM optimized structure of the base molecule.
In the current version Paratool supports the autogeneration of input
files for <a href="http://www.gaussian.com">Gaussian</a> but later
versions will also provide an interface to 
<a href="http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/GAMESS/GAMESS.html">GAMESS</a>.
(For this task Paratool uses 
<a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/qmtool">QMtool</a> 
which you can also use stand-alone to setup and analyze QM simulations.)
<p>
You can obtain the respective interface through the "File->Setup QM
optimization". The meaning of the buttons can be found 
<a href="qmsetup.html">here</a>.
In most cases the default values provided by Paratool should be
fine, but it is important that you check the total charge and the
multiplicity since these are difficult or impossible to guess
automatically. a good choice for the simulation method and the basis
set are RHF/6-31G* and UB3LYP/6-31+G* for metal containing molecules. 
<p>
After the Gausian setup file has been written you have to run it yourself.
When you load the resulting logfile, the last frame denoting the optimized structure
will be appended to the base molecule which makes it possible to
easily switch the view between the original and the optimized
geometry. Additionally, a new molecule containing all optimization
steps, will be loaded in VMD. It will not be shown automatically but
you can enable it by hand in the VMD Main window.


<h3> Hessian and atomic charges from QM single point calculation</h3>
Based on the optimized geometry another QM calculation has to
be performed. (In future versions these two steps might be
merged). Choose "Hessian->Setup QM single point calc. (Hessian, charges)"
to open the same form as for the QM optimization but now with
different default values. Again, after writing the setup file you must
run the simulation manually and subsequently load the logfile using
the appropriate entry in the "File" menu.
<p>
...


<h3>Assigning charges</h3>
Suppose you want charmm style charges:
First you must use copy base charges (e.g. Mulliken) into the charge
field in the "Edit atom properties" window. These charges will be
scaled such that the force field interaction with TIP3 water matches
the QM interaction energy. 

<h4>CHARMM style charges</h4>
Unfortunately Paratool does not support CHARMM type charge development 
yet but the following gives an idea what you have to do. For more info refer to 
<a
href="http://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/faculty/amackere/supplem/ParamOpt_MacKerell.pdf">
Alex Mackerell's parameter optimization tutorial</a>

In the CHARMM protocol the charges for the polar groups are chosen
such that the interaction energy in
the force field between the molecule in question and a TIP3 water
molecule is the same as the interaction energy determined by quantum
mechanical calculations (HF/6-31G*).
The interaction energy is determined by subtracting the energy of a
water molecule and the energy of the system from the energy of the
supramolecular complex:
<pre>
  E(system+water)
- E(system)
- E(water)
----------------
= E(interaction)
</pre>
Before comparision the QM interaction energy should be scaled with the 
empirical factor of 1.16. At the same time the force field based optimal 
distance should be 0.2A shorter that the HF/6-31G* value.
The hydration sites are all polar subgroups of the model compound.
One typically sets the charges of the direct interaction partner and 
its mother atom(s).
Further all nonpolar hydrogens should obtain a charge of 0.09e.
If your model compound is designed properly there will be carbons to use
to "neutralize" the entire charge; this could be aliphatic or aromatic
carbons that are not involved in significant hydrogen bonding.

<!--
Select the CHARMM charges dialog from the menu.
First you must define charge groups that shall finally have a total charge
of -1, 0 or 1. (You can set the desired group charge.) If you define
the charge group as unpolar, the hydrogen charges will be set to 0.09
and the rest is scaled accordingly. For all polar or charged groups
you'll need to set up a QM geometry optimization of the supramolecular
complex of your molecule with water. Paratool includes Gaussian
optimized water 
logfiles for most of the common basis sets which will be loaded
automatically. Otherwise you must provide it yourself. The water
molecule will be placed in front of the first atom of the group and
rotated depending on the initial charges of the group. You can adjust
distance and orientation using the buttons, spinbox and slider. The
better your starting conformation the the faster will be the QM
optimization. 
<p>
Now you can setup the simulation. It is generally save to use the
default parameters provided by Paratool. After you ran the gaussian setup file.
you can load the logfile and the energy balance will be
completed. Finally hitting the Scale button to scale the charges accoudingly. 

The initial charges are set automatically, by default from the
Mulliken field, but you can also request initialization from other
fields. If you choose "None" then the current charges (in the "Charge"
field) will be used. This allows you to hand tailor your initial
charges if you don't like the defaults. 
The hydrogens of neutral groups and in beta position to the
interacting atom can be set automatically to 0.09 as demanded by the
charmm protocol and their mother atom charge is adjusted
accordingly. You should set the total group charge to an integer
value. You can also setup the necessary charmm simulations of
the system+water complex. When you load the logfiles the Interaction
energy will be displayed. 
-->

<h4>AMBER style charges (RESP)</h4>
Charges for the AMBER force field are based on the restricted
electrostatic potential fit (RESP) method. The charges are fitted in
two stages against the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) that
was determined before in the QM single point calculation:
1) Fit to the potential is carried out with weak restraints (weight=0.0005au) but
   without forced symmetry on groups with equivalent nonpolar hygrogens e.g. methyl
   groups. The target charge of the restraint is normally zero, in order to
   counteract the tendency of ESP to produce very high charge values on buried
   atoms. No restraints on hydrogens because they are all well solvent exposed.
   Equivalent atoms other than these nonpolar hydrogens are
   constrained to have the same charge.

2) Refit of only those nonpolar hydrogen bearing groups
   (e.g. methyl, methylene, methine) but now using forced symmetry and
   strong restraints (weight=0.001au). Charges of all other atoms
   (e.g. polar groups) are fixed in the second state.

<h3>Parameter refinement</h3>
Another problem for automatic parametrization procedures is the the
double accounting of electrostatics, especially in 1-4
interactions. It is explicitly modeled in the Coulomb term but
it's is also implicitely included in the bonded terms since the
internal Hessian is an equilibrium approximation of the totality of
all interactions. In order to account for this problem
Paratool offers a method to correct the bonded terms. The
difficulty here is that the corresponding terms are often mutually
dependent. Paratool computes an effective target potential
of each internal coordinate for the refinement process. This means
that not all parameters have to be fitted simultaneously which would
not be practicable but only linear dependent subgroups.

---Easy generation of force field parameters---


For the determination of torsional force constants it is not necessary
to specify all dihedral angles that can be derived from the bondlist,
because many of them describe the torsion around the same bond just
with a different phase. Therefore it is sufficient to pick one
quadruple of atoms describing the torsion and divide the value of the
force constant by the number of contributing dihedrals.

In CHARMM and AMBER the potential energy of torsions is described by 
V(phi)  = sum_n[k_phi*(1-cos(n*phi-delta))], n=1,2,3,...
   k_phi = force constant
   n = multiplicity
   delta = phase angle
while the local harmonic approximation is
U(phi) = k/2*phi^2

Let's choose the reference so that delta=0 and compare the cosine
ansatz with the harmonic ansatz:

V(phi)  = k_phi*(1-cos(n*phi-delta));	U(phi)  = k/2*phi^2
V'(phi) = k_phi*sin(n*phi)*n;		U'(phi) = k*phi
V"(phi) = k_phi*n^2*cos(n*phi);		U"(phi) = k
V"(0)   = k_phi*n^2                     U"(0)   = k

  V"(0) = U"(0)
  k_phi = k/n^2

We see that the harmonic force constant is the same as the one from
the periodic decscription as long as we are close to the equilibrium.
Thus barrier height is not at all well determined.
In case we want to describe molecular entities that deviate far from
their torsional equilibrium, we have to do a potential energy scan in
order to sample certain values of the energy profile. Unfortunately
Paratool does not yet have any functionality for this last task.


Paratool functionality
======================


Setting up Gaussian simulations
-------------------------------

Paratool provides aid in setting up input files for Gaussian
simulations. You can choose various simulation parameters such as
method and basis set via option menus but the most important feature
is the specification of the input coordinates and of internal
coordinates for the determination of force constants. Gaussian accepts
different forms of input coordinates: Cartesian coordinates or a
Z-matrix of 3*n-6 nonredundant internal coordinates. For geometry
optimizations a set of redundant internal coordinates is often
desireable. It can be autogenerated by Gaussian independently (keyword
Opt=Redundant) thus we can use cartesian coordinates as the
most convenient input format. These autogenerated coordinate set can
be modified or extended by other coordinates in a special section
in the input file (keyword Opt/Freq=ModRedundant). Paratool uses this
feature to let you specify your own set of redundant internal
coordinates. To achieve this Paratool generates a Gaussian setup file
that uses cartesian coordinates as input, deletes all autogenerated
internal coordinates and adds all coordinates that are defined in
Paratools list. If the number of coordinates is less than 3*n-6,
you'll get a warning message.



Determine CHARMM type charges
-----------------------------

In the CHARMM protocol the charges for the polar groups are obtained
by scaling the Mulliken charges such that the interaction energy in
the force field between the molecule in question and a TIP3 water
molecule is the same as the interaction energy determined by quantum
mechanical calculations.
The interaction energy is determined by subtracting the energy of a
water molecule and the energy of the system from the energy of the
supermolecule.:

  E(system+water)
- E(system)
- E(water)
----------------
= E(interaction)

Paratool can aid in setting up the necessary Gaussian files and it
determines the energy difference.

This is what you have to do:
1) Load the optimized structure of your system
2) Open the 'CHARMM type charges' window and pick the atoms comprising
   the polar charge group you want to study
3) Load the structure of the optimized water molecule
4) Adjust the position and orientation of the water.
5) Merge the system with the water, a new molecule will be loaded.
6) Setup a Gaussian optimization with the supermolecule
7) Load the optimization results

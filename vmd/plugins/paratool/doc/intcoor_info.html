<h2>Choice of internal coordinates:</h2>

One has to distinguish between the coordinates used for QM geometry
optimizations and the ones defining bonded interactions in force fields:
For geometry optimizations the choice of the coordinate system does
not influence the result of the calculation but it can have a
dramatic effect on the number of computational steps needed to reach
the equilibrium geometry. In many cases redundant internal coordinates
are a far better choice than cartesian coordinates [Pulay 1977]. Many
QM packages have built in methods for automatic generation of internal
coordinates. In Gaussian this is requested by the Opt=Redundant keyword. 
<p>
For the determination of force constants the choice of coordinates
depends on the type of force field. The task is to find a set of
internal coordinates that implies low coupling between them and that
facilitates transferability. Furthermore molecular compounds should be
easy to combine into new molecules. The coordinates chosen in the
topology files of CHARMM and AMBER force fields denote a good
compromise between these requirements. 
First, all covalent bonds of a molecule are defined. Then, unless
specified explicitely in the topology file, the the angles and 
dihedrals are autogenerated, i.e. all possible angles and dihedrals
that can be constructed from the given bonds are generated.
<p>
However, in some cases it can be better to remove linear bends if they
exist from the angle list because the force constant denotes the
curvature of the potential energy function along the steepest gradient
but the geometry can change two dimensions. Linear bends are included
in the autogeneration so you must delete them manually if you don't
want them. Examples for such linear bends are the ones between opposite
ligands and the central atom in octahedral transition metal complexes.
<p>
The force constants from the Hessian matrix are based on the local harmonic
approximation of the potential surface with respect to the given
coordinate. Consequently the description of the potential energy is
only correct in the vincinity of the equilibrium geometry.
For covalent bonds and bond angles the geometry is not deviated to far
from the equilibrium by typical thermal energies. However, for bond
torsions the situation is different. Many torsional barriers are low
enough that rotation around 360 degrees or at least a large deviation
from equilibrium is possible.

<!--#set var="TITLE" value="VTF Plugin, Version 1.3"-->
<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->
The plugin reads files written in the VTF 
trajectory/structure/coordinate format, which is described in 
<a href="https://github.com/olenz/vtfplugin/wiki/VTF-format">more detail here</a>.

The format was designed especially for VMD and is useful for hand-written 
simulation codes and coarse-grained simulations. It is currently used by the 
<a href="http://espressomd.org/">ESPResSo</a> coarse-grained
simulation package.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>
<b>Read-only</b>
<br>This plugin is used only to read files. VMD does not currently support
writing this file type.

<p>This plugin reads and writes molecular coordinate data stored in the
RCSB Protein Data Bank
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/file_formats/pdb/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html">PDB file format</a>.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p><b>Support for non-standard PDB files</b>
The PDB plugin will accept a number of variations of the PDB
file format which are technically violations of the specification.
These include files containing more than 99,999 ATOM/HETATM records,
ATOM records with serial number fields extending into the space reserved
for record keywords, and various other transgressions.

<p><b>ATOM, HETATM records</b>
The PDB plugin processes all fields in the ATOM and HETATM records.

<p><b>CONECT records</b>
VMD reads all CONECT records and treats them as an indication of
"special" bonds that are noteworthy beyond the obvious ones that a
simple distance based search would find.  VMD reads all of the bonds
from the CONECT records, and then adds the bonds found by an automatic
distance search, skipping any duplicates.

<p><b>HEADER record</b>
The PDB header accession code, data, and classification
information information are read from the header, but only the 
accession code and date are returned by the plugin.

<p><b>REMARK records</b>
All REMARK records are read and returned to VMD by the plugin.

<p><b>Alternate Location Identifiers</b>
Some PDB files contain ATOM records with non-empty alternate location
identifiers (AltLoc) which indicate alternative conformations for parts of the
structure.  VMD 1.8.4 and above reads the AltLoc fields and uses them to 
prevent generation of spurious bonds between conformations of the structure,
and to allow differet conformations to be selected using the "altloc" atom
selection keyword.

<p><b>Interpretation of atom serial numbers</b>
<br>
Since PDB files can only store 99,999 atoms without overrunning the
columns designated for atom indices etc, the PDB plugin doesn't directly 
use the atom indices specified in the PDB file as its own indices, instead 
it keeps its own independent atom index counter, allowing it to read files
containing millions of atoms.  The atom index field for atoms beyond 99,999
may contain alphanumeric characters, or some other unique string scheme,
as has commonly been used in software such as X-PLOR/CNS, and other packages.
</p>

<p><b>Unit Cell</b>
<br>
The PDB plugin reads in the CRYST1 unit cell information for use with 
periodic image display when available. 

<p><b>Multi-structure PDB files</b>
The PDB plugin reads multi-structure PDB files and treats them 
as an trajectory of atom positions, if each structure contains
the same number of atoms.  If the subsequent structures have mismatched
atom counts, only the first structure is returned.

<p><b>Unused data</b>
<br>
Various PDB record types and fields are ignored by VMD, in general
VMD doesn't do anything with the sequence data or crystallography-specific 
fields in the format presently.  
<br>
All unused PDB records are returned as remark data by the PDB plugin,
allowing this information to be parsed and accessed by plugins.
While somewhat hackish and generally not how we'd prefer to do things,
much of the information provided in PDB files is fairly free format,
or provided in REMARK lines anyway, so this provides a means of getting
at it, for plugins that are crafty enough to read this information.

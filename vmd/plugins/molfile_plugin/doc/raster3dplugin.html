<p>This plugin reads and displays Raster3D scene files in VMD.  
  
<h1>Notes:</h1>
<p><b>Unused data</b>
<br>
The Raster3D scene file format has changed, adding new features and
capabilities over the last few years.  VMD supports a limited 
subset of these features, those geometric and scene description 
elements that are representable within VMD's rendering built-in
system.

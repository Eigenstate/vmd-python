<!--#set var="TITLE" value="COR Plugin, Version 0.9"-->
<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

<p>This plugin reads molecular coordinate data stored in 
<a href="http://brooks.scripps.edu/charmm_docs/TSRI_docs-list.htm">CHARMM</a>
Cartesian Coordinate format. More information about this file format can be
found below.

<p>Note that the files created by CHARMM normally carry the extension
<tt>.crd</tt>. Since this extension is also used by 
<a href="crdplugin.html">Amber 7</a> trajectory files, the filetype must be
explicitly set to <tt>cor</tt> when opening a Cartesian Coordinate File in
VMD. This extra step can be omitted by renaming the file and changing the
the extension to <tt>cor</tt>.</p>


<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Read-only</b>
<br>This plugin is used only to read files. VMD does not currently support
writing this file type.</p>

<p><b>Unused data</b>
<br>The <tt>Weight</tt> field, which can be used to store atom-dependent
data such as mass or charge is ignored by VMD.</p>

<p><b>ASCII format</b>
<br>This plugin reads only ASCII, or "formatted" COOR files. Binary
coordinated files produced by CHARMM are presently not supported by VMD.

<h3>Format of the CHARMm coordinate file</h3>
<pre>
CHARMm coordinate files contain information about the location of each atom in Cartesian (3D) space. The format of the ASCII (CARD) CHARMm coordinate files is:
    * Title line(s)
    * Number of atoms in file
    * Coordinate line (one for each atom in the file)

The coordinate lines contain specific information about each atom in the model and consist of the following fields:
    * Atom number (sequential)
    * Residue number (specified relative to first residue in the PSF)
    * Residue name
    * Atom type
    * X-coordinate
    * Y-coordinate
    * Z-coordinate
    * Segment identifier
    * Residue identifier
    * Weighting array value

The FORTRAN FORMAT statement for the coordinate lines is:

I5, I5, 1X, A4, 1X, A4, 3(F10.5), 1X, A4, 1X, A4, F10.5

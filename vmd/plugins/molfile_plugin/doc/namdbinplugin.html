<!--#set var="TITLE" value="NAMDBin Plugin, Version 0.2"-->
<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

<p>This plugin reads and writes NAMD binary restart files produced by 
   all versions of NAMD dating all the way back to NAMD 1.x. 

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p><b>Floating Point Precision</b>
<p>
This plugin reads and writes NAMD binary coordinate files, however
the full precision of coordinates are not maintained in either
the read or write processes, since the plugin interface currently uses 
single precision floating point numbers for atom coordinates.

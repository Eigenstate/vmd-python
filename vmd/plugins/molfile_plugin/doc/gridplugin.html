<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

<p>This plugin reads electron density maps created by Molecular Discovery's
<a href="http://www.moldiscovery.com/soft_grid.php">GRID program</a>, also
used by UHBD, and other software. 

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Read-only</b>
<br>This plugin is used only to read files. VMD does not currently support
writing this file type.</p>

<p><b>Format Uncertainty</b>
Not sure if slicing order is the same in every file.
</p>

<p><b>Unused data</b>
This plugin doesn't read in all data stored in the file, in particular
various plane metadata.</p>

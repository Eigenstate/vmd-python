<p>
This plugin reads the regular and the animated form of XCrySDen structure
files (.xsf and .axsf) as they are read and written by the 
<a href="http://www.xcrysden.org/">XCrySDen</a> visualization 
program and created by the <a href="http://www.quantum-espresso/">Quantum Espresso</a>
(also known as <a href="http://www.pwscf.org/">PWScf</a>)
package of plane wave DFT based electronic 
structure and MD programs. The format allows storing of atomic
data with or without periodicity in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions, variable
cell size trajectories and multiple 2d, and 3d grid data set.
See the extensive
<a href="http://www.xcrysden.org/doc/XSF.html">format description</a>
on the XCrySDen home page for more details.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Trajectories</b>
<br>This plugin supports animation XSF files (axsf) even in 
combination with grid data sets.  All timesteps, however 
have to have the same number of atoms (VMD does not support this
currently anyways). Also the elements have to always be in the same
order, only the first timestep will be used to read the element names.
From all successive timesteps only the coordinates will be read.

<p><b>Coordinate Rotation / Periodic Display</b>
<br>VMD currently can only display periodic images of the 
unit cell correctly, if the first cell vector is collinear
with the x-axis and the second cell vector in the xy-plane.
Upon loading of the xsf file, the coordinates and the 
grid vectors are rotated accordingly. Unfortunately, that
may make the atomic positions incompatible to some other
coordinate files containing matching coordinates, but no
unit cell information.

<p><b>Atom Masses</b>
<br>The plugin assigns masses to the atoms according to the 
natural isotope distribution of the elements (see e.g.
<a href="http://www.webelements.com/">http://www.webelements.com/</a>).
If an element could not been recognized, a mass of 0 is assigned.
To set the mass for those elements or assign a different mass for
the other atoms, you have to use to create a selection with
<b>atomselect</b> and then use the selection subcommands to set
the mass.

<p><b>Conventional Cell Coordinates</b>
<br>This plugin currently only reads the primitive unit
cell vectors and coordinates. Data for the conventional
cell will be ignored.

<p><b>2D Data Grids</b>
<br>VMD does not currently provide visualizations for 
two-dimensional data grids or means to store them, so this
plugin ignores those data sets.

<p><b>Incompatibilities</b>
<br>The plugin follows the description of the format on the XCrySDen
homepage, but due to the differences between the parsers, files that may
be readable without a problem in XCrySDen, will not read completely or
correctly by this plugin. A few examples were already spotted 'in the
wild' and the required amendmends to the plugins were made.

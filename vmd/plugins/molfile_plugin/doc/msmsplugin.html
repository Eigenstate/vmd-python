<p>This plugin reads and displays MSMS surface files described
by the MSMS vertex and facet output files.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
This plugin requires both the vertex and the facet file in order
to successfully load the MSMS surface data.  The two files are
expected to be named filename.vert and filename.face, as they 
would be produced by MSMS.
Since MSMS surface files are a 'finished product' type of data,
they can't be manipulated very much within VMD when they are
computed outside of VMD, though they can be displayed.

<p><b>Unused data</b>
At present, the plugin doesn't provide atom index data from 
the surface facet file.  The surface is loaded using the active
user-defined graphics drawing color.

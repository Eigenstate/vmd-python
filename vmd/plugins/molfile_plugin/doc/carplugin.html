Cartesian Coordinate format. More information about this file format can be
found here:

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Read-only</b>
<br>This plugin is used only to read files. VMD does not currently support
writing this file type.</p>

<p><b>Multiple molecules</b>
<br>CAR files can contain multiple molecule entries; only the first of these
is read by the plugin. Multiple molecule support may be available in the
future.

<p><b>Periodic Boundary Condition (PBC) information</b>
<br>This plugin currently ignores any two-dimensional PBC information that
may be present. 3D PBC info, however, is loaded into VMD.

<p><b>Helix records</b>
<br>These records are also ignored by VMD.

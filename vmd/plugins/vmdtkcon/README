Description
-----------

This package encapsulates the TkCon 2.3 console into a VMD plugin. TkCon 
is an enhanced console for Tcl/Tk which allows for functionality not 
available in the standard UNIX Tcl/tk console, such as history and history 
navigation, automatic command and filename completion, syntax 
highlighting, and regular shell commands such as "alias", "ls", etc.

Files included here: 
* tkcon-2.3/ is the standard TkCon distribution from 
http://tkcon.sourceforge.net/
* tkcon-modified.tcl is a modified copy of the tkcon.tcl v2.3, which 
prevents it from quitting VMD when the user merely closes the console.
* vmdtkcon.tcl is a VMD package that makes sure that calls TkCon and makes 
sure loads correctly in VMD and allows it to me incorporated in VMD's menu 
structure.


Issues with TkCon 2.4
---------------------

There is a new version of TkCon. It has not been added to VMD, since it 
does not work very well. Here are some problems discovered with it that 
need to be remediated before a new version of TkCon is added to VMD.
 - "New Console" brings up an empty window
 - New Tabs are opened with a new interpreter that is not connected to 
VMD. This new feature and extra space taken is thus of no use to VMD 
users, since VMD only seems to support one interpreter at this time. The 
new "set ::tkcon::OPT(exec) {}" setting does not work as described and 
does not help.
 - The Close/Quit menu generates an error message. 
Conclusion: new features are not very useful to VMD, and a few minutes of 
usage brought up new bugs that weren't present in 2.3.

Additional note: To use the new tkcon 2.4, the new call "tkcon show" must 
be called from within vmdtkcon.

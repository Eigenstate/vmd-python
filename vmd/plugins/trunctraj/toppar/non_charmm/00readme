This directory contains topology and parameter files that are
compatible with CHARMM but are not part of the CHARMM force field
development efforts.  The parameters have been approved by the
original developers, or individuals closely associated with those
developers.  However, they have not been exhaustively tested in the
context of CHARMM and are not supported.  Please carefully read the
header sections of the respective files to obtain information on their
proper use along with the appropriate references.

AMBER Cornell 94 force field for proteins and nucleic acids and the
1998 variant of the nucleic acid parameters. Requires CHARMM compiled
with AMBER keyword in pref.dat.  Note that such versions of CHARMM can
NOT be used with the CHARMM force field.

<!--#set var="TITLE" value="Exectool Plugin, Version 1.0"-->
<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

<p>Exectool provides a robust means of executing external programs 
on the local computer, <a href="biocore.html">or remotely</a>
on behalf of other plugins.  


<p>
The primary features of exectool are syntactic emulation 
of Tcl's built-in ::exec funcion, but with functionality for automatically
searching for executables in the user's path, with fall-back code for
allowing a user to specify the location of a missing executable rather
than failing silently as often happens with Tcl's ::exec function.

<p>Exectool also provides features for running jobs in the background,
and may be extended to replace some of the built-in job execution 
functionality found in more sophisticated plugins such as AutoIMD
as work progresses.

<dl>
  <dt><code>::ExecTool::exec</code></dt>
  <dd>Drop-in replacement for ::exec. Before running the program, it
  searches Exectool's registry for the program, prompting the user for its
  location if not found.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><code>::ExecTool::find [-interactive] [-path &lt;path&gt;] 
    [-description &lt;text&gt;] mnemonic</code></dt>
  <dd>Search for the program by the provided mnemonic. Returns the full path
  to the executable if it is found, and the empty list otherwise.
  Options:<br> 
  
  [-interactive] - if specified and Tk is available, the user is prompted
  for missing information.<br> 
  
  [-path <path>] - if specified, the given path is tested before continuing
  the search<br> 
  
  [-description <text>] - if specified and the mnemonic is not registered,
  the description defaults to the given text while prompting the user and
  returning the path.</dd>
</dl>

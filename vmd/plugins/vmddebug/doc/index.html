<p>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>
This <b>vmddebug</b> plugin provides a frontend to debugging and 
tracing facilities for VMD. To activate the plugin, you have to
<i>require</i> it from the VMD console prompt. This will add a
new command, <tt>debug</tt>, to the Tcl interpreter that acts as
interface to all included debug and tracing funtionality.</p>
<p>
The general syntax is:</p>
<pre>
  debug subcommand argument [more arguments]
</pre>
<p>Currently only one subcommand, <tt>atomselect</tt>, is supported.

<p>
<h3>atomselect:</h3>
<p>
A debug tool to monitor allocation and usage of atom 
selection function created through Tcl scripting. Its
most important use is help finding "selection leaks",
i.e. when selections are created, but not correspondingly
deleted. This happens most commonly when atom selections
are created inside a loop or not assigned to a variable
for bookkeeping and later deletion.</p>
<h4>Automatic deletion of atom selections</h4>
<p>VMD employs a special Tcl construct to give atom selections
only local scope, i.e. the atom selection is tied to a local
variable and automatically deleted, when that variable goes
out of scope. However, this construct does not help when
atom selections are created on the top level (e.g. on the 
VMD console) or when new selections are created inside a
(nested) loop of a procedure where the storage required
for all created atom selections becomes too large before
it goes out of scope. The deleting atom selections explicitly
is therefore strongly recommended and the <tt>debug atomselect</tt>
tool will print a warning whenever an atomselection is 
automatically deleted through the local variable tie.
</p>

<pre>
Usage: debug atomselect &lt;flag&gt;

Available flags:
  on      : enable tracing of atom selections
  off     : disable tracing of atom selections
  verbose : verbosely report atomselect operations
  silent  : don't report atomselect operations
  stats   : print statistics (active/added/deleted)
  help    : print this message
</pre>

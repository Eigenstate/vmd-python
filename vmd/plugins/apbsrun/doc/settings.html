<p>This window provides access to plugin-specific configuration options.

<h3>APBS Location and Working Directory</h3>

<p>The full path to the APBS executable and Working Directory can be entered
in these fields. The "Browse" button opens a file/directory selector to help
find the path of either field. 

<p>The APBS configuration file and all necessary molecules (in PQR format)
are written to the working directory before APBS is run. Any files created
by APBS will also be located here, including maps. Note that the APBS plugin
doesn't automatically delete any files created during the course of an APBS
Run, so it may be necessary to manually empty the working directory
periodically.

<h3>Miscellaneous Options</h3>

<p>If the "Setup files only..." option is selected, the plugin will write an
APBS configuration file and all necessary molecules to the working
directory, without calling APBS to make any calculations. This allows the
plugin to be used for more complicated APBS runs, in case an option is
unavailable in the <a href="elec.html">ELEC Window</a>. It is also useful if
APBS is to run on a different host than the one upon which VMD is running.

<!--update the following paragraph when auto-charges are available--> 

<p>The plugin can be configured to override the atom radii currently loaded
in VMD with those listed in a CHARMM parameter file. This is useful when
VMD's simple radius-guessing heuristic is inappropriate for electrostatics
calculations. Note that atom radii are only guessed by VMD when no radius
information has been explicitly loaded by a file-format that supports it.

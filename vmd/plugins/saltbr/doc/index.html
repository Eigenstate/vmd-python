    <p>The Salt Bridges plugin searches for salt bridges formed in a protein
      throughout a trajectory. The search can be restricted to a selection
      and/or a frame range given by the user.</p>

    <h3>Criteria for the formation of a salt bridge</h3>
    
    <p>A salt bridge is considered to be formed if the distance between
    <i>any</i> of the oxygen atoms of acidic residues and the nitrogen atoms of
    basic residues are within the cut-off distance (default 3.2
    Angstroms) in at least one frame. The default distance cut-off can
    be changed by the user.  This plugin does not attempt to identify
    hydrogen bonds.</p>
    
    <p>An additional distance cut-off between the centers of mass of the
    side-chain heavy atoms of oppositely charged residues can be
    specified.</p>
    
    <h3>Acidic and basic residues</h3>

    <p>The Salt Bridges plugin searches for salt bridges between amino acid
      residues identified with the VMD keywords <tt>acidic</tt> and
      <tt>basic</tt>, which are defined in the following way:</p>


<!--<ul>
    <li type=circle><tt>atomselect macro acidic "resname ASP GLU"</tt></li>
    <li type=circle><tt>atomselect macro basic "resname ARG HIS LYS HSP"</tt></li>
</ul>-->

    <p><tt>atomselect macro acidic "resname ASP GLU"</tt></p>
    <p><tt>atomselect macro basic "resname ARG HIS LYS HSP"</tt></p>

    <p>In particular, this means that if all the histidine residues have resname
      HIS (often the case in original PDB files), all of them will be considered
      in the salt bridges calculation. On the other hand, if the histidine
      residues have resnames HSP, HSD, or HSE (as specified in the CHARMM force
      field), only the protonated histidines HSP will  be considered in
      the calculation.</p>

<h3>Update selections every frame</h3>

<p style="margin: 0 0 -1.0em 0">This plugin uses atom selections based on
the atom selection given by the user. There are some cases in which the
atom selection might change in time, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li type=circle><tt>within</tt> or <tt>exwithin</tt> are used</li>
  <li type=circle>any one of the coordinates are used in a comparison (e.g., "<tt>x &gt;
3</tt type=circle>"), or say "<tt>sqrt(sqr(x-50) + y*y + z*z) &gt; 25)</tt>"</li>
  <li type=circle>the selection is based on atoms next to specific voxel values</li>
  <li type=circle>the "user" field is used in a selection (time varying)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the selection used does not change in time, the option "update
selections every frame" can safely be disabled, which will increase the
efficiency of the calculation.</p>

<h3>Output files</h3>

<p>By default, a file is written for each salt bridge, containing the frame
      number and the distance between the center of mass of the oxygens in the
      acidic side chain and center of mass of the nitrogens in the basic
      side chain. Note that this distance is slightly different than the 
      criteria used to identify salt bridges (see above).
      </p>

<h3>Command-line interface</h3>

<p>All the functionalities of the plugin are also available through the
command line interface.</p>

<p>Usage: <tt>saltbr -sel &lt;atom selection&gt; &lt;option1&gt;
  &lt;option2&gt; ...</tt></p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 -1.0em 0">Options:</p>

<ul>
  <li type=circle><tt>-upsel &lt;yes|no&gt; (update atom selections every
    frame? default: yes)</tt></li>
  <li type=circle><tt>-frames &lt;begin:end&gt; or &lt;begin:step:end&gt; or all or now (default: all)</tt></li>
  <li type=circle><tt>-ondist &lt;cutoff distance between oxygen and
    nitrogen atoms&gt; (default: 3.2)</tt></li>
  <li type=circle><tt>-comdist &lt;cutoff distance between centers of mass of side chains&gt; (default: none)</tt></li>
  <li type=circle><tt>-writefiles &lt;yes|no&gt; (default: yes)</tt></li>
  <li type=circle><tt>-outdir &lt;output directory&gt; (default:
    current)</tt></li>
  <li type=circle><tt>-log &lt;log filename&gt; (default: none)</tt></li>
</ul>

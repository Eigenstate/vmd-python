The ViewChangeRender plugin can be found in the Extension->Visualization menu
and provides an easy-to-use interface for 
managing sets of VMD viewpoints, and performing camera moves between
the views. Provided is the interface you see to the right that allows you to
store and manage viewpoints, as well as move between them. Also provided is an interface to the <a href="/Research/vmd/plugins/vmdmovie/">Movie Maker</a> plugin via its <i>user-defined script</i> movie option. With the combination of these two plugins, it is easy to make movies that can change views while progressing through a dcd file.
<br><br>
The top half of the window is dedicated to managing viewpoints, while the
bottom half of the window is dedicated to constructing and editing the movie. 
<br><br>
The shortest steps to making a movie is as follows:<br>
1. Load a molecule into VMD.<br>
2. Open ViewChangeRender.<br>
3. Save two viewpoints and add them to the movie list.<br>
4. Change the movie duration with the <b>Set Total Time</b> button.<br>
5. Open the <b>Extension->Visualization->Movie Maker</b> plugin<br>
6. In the Movie Settings menu (in the Movie Maker window), select
User-Defined Procedure.<br>
7. Click the <b>Enable</b> button in the ViewChangeRender window.<br>
8. Click <b>Make Movie</b> in the Movie Maker window.<br>
<br>
Below the specific function avialable in ViewChangeRender is detailed.
<h2>Viewpoint Management</h2>
<p> A viewpoint is defined as the collection of variables that specify the
camera angle and position, as well as the frame number for all molecules. This
means that any given viewpoint could be used with any given trajectory. It is
thus important to remember which files were loaded for a given set of
viewpoints. The currently saved viewpoints are numbered in the viewpoint list labelled "Viewpoint #".
For viewpoint management, the following functions are available</p>

<p>
<b> Save Viewpoint </b><br>
This stores the present viewpoint, as seen in the VMD Display, as a new entry in the viewpoint list.<br>
<br>
<b> Replace Viewpoint </b><br>
This replaces the presently selected viewpoint in the viewpoint list with
that currently shown in the VMD Display. <br>
<br>
<b> Insert Viewpoint </b><br>
This inserts a viewpoint after the presently selected viewpoint in the
viewpoint list. Proceeding viewpoint numbers will increase to account for the
newly inserted viewpoint.<br>
<br>
<b> Delete Viewpoint</b><br>
This removed the selected viewpoint from the viewpoint list.<br>
<br>
<b> Renumber Viewpoint</b><br>
Using this button you can change the number of a selected viewpoint. Note you
can only change to an unused number.
</p>
<h2> Displaying Viewpoints </h2>
<p>
There are two buttons to change to any selected viewpoint in the viewpoint
list:
<br><br>
<b> Retrieve Viewpoint </b><br>
Clicking this button will change the current view in the VMD Display
window to the selected viewpoint in the viewpoint list.<br>
<br>
<b>Move To Viewpoint</b><br>
Using this button, you can move smoothly from the current view in the VMD
Display window to the one selected in the viewpoint list. If the selected
viewpoint is associated to a different frame, the frames will be animated
through.
</p>
<h2> Movie Control</h2>
<p>
Using the <b>Add Viewpoint to Movie</b> or <b>Add All Viewpoints to Movie</b>
you can add viewpoint into the movie list (the list in the lower half of the
windowd). The time that appears next to a frame number in the movie list is the
time in seconds it will take to transition from that frame to the next one down
in the list. When a viewpoint is added the default transition time is the
difference in the trajectory frames x the framerate. I.e. if viewpoint #1 is at frame 0 and viewpoint #2 is at frame 240, then the transition time from 1->2 will be 240/24 = 10 secs (the default framerate is 24 fps and can be changed in the Movie Maker plugin). If the difference in the trajectory frames of the viewpoints is 0, then a default transition time of 0.5 seconds is assigned. <br>
<br>
Changing the total time sets a scaling factor such that any editing that is
dobe to the movie (viewpoint order or the addition or removal of viewpoints)
the transitions times are changed appropriately. If, however, you change a
specific transition time, this will be lost in any editing changes that
involve the specific transition.<br>
<br>
The function of each button is detailed below:</p>
<br>
<b> Remove From Movie </b><br>
This removes the viewpoint selected in the movie list from the list of movies.
Transition times are update appropriately as detailed above.<br>
<br>
<b>Move Up</b><br>
This button moves the selected viewpoint up in the movie list. Note that this will
re-calculate the transition times for the transitions affected.<br>
<br>
<b>Move Down</b><br>
This button moves the selected viewpoint down in the movie list. Note that this will
re-calculate the transition times for the transitions affected.<br>
<br>
<b>Clear List</b><br>
This will clear the list allowing you to create a new movie.<br>
<br>
<b>Change Transition Time</b><br>
This button will alter the transition time of the selected transition in the
movie list. The total duration of the movie will be updated accordingly<br>
<br>
<b>Set Total Time</b><br>
This button is used to change the total duration of the movie. Note that this
will update all the transitions to reflect their new transition times such that
their total is the newly entered time.<br>
<br></p>
<h2>Movie Maker Connection</h2>
The <a href="/Research/vmd/plugins/vmdmovie/">Movie Maker</a> plugin is used to
render a movie from the movie list. Clicking the <b>Enable</b> button will
allow ViewChangeRender to set the movie duration in movie maker, and will
enable Movie Maker to process the movie list when the User Defined Procedure
setting is selected in Movie Maker.

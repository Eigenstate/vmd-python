    <p>This plugin provides a graphical interface to compute spectral densities
      from trajectories using time series data created with the <tt>measure dipole</tt>
      command in VMD and a custom spectral densities plugin to compute the auto-correlated 
      Fourier transform. Please note that this is using the <b>total dipole moment</b> 
      of all atoms in the selection and not averaging over individual molecules.
      The latter and other types of auto-correlations can be computed through 
      the script interface of the <tt>specden</tt> command which is part of 
      the <a href="../signalproc/">SignalProc</a> plugin collection and 
      described in the respective documentation. The spectral 
      density plugin also supports a selection of thermal corrections to the 
      peak intensities. It is recommended to stick to the default setting 
      (harmonic) unless you know what you are doing.
      You have to have a trajectory already loaded and have the option to 
      view the resulting spectrum in a <a href="../multiplot/">MultiPlot</a>
      window and write it to a file.</p>

    <h3>Remarks</h3>
<img style="border: 0; padding: 0 0 1em 1em" src="multiplot_spectrum.png" align="right">
    <p>In order to get meaningful results, the selection of atoms has to
    have (partial) charges assigned, so loading a corresponding topology
    file (.psf, .parm7), that contains this information is highly
    recommended. For cases, where this is not available, you have the
    options to either guess charges using the CHARMM guess routine from
    the <a href="../apbsrun/">APBSrun plugin</a> or to load an atom name
    to charge mapping from an external file. Instead of using the simple
    guess, you may want to consider using the 
    <a href="../autopsf/">AutoPSF plugin</a> to create a matching .psf file
    for your system.</p>
     
    <p>This plugin can also be used to compute spectral densities from
    ab initio MD simulations, if one has computed maximally localized
    Wannier functions along the trajectory. A corresponding manually
    loadable charge mapping would look like be following (element X
    stands for the Wannier centers):</p>
<pre>
     # pseudopotential valence charges from cpmd run. 
     Zn  12.0 
     O    6.0 
     N    5.0
     C    4.0
     H    1.0
     X   -2.0 # electron pairs from localization
</pre>

<p>
Multiple Alignment aligns multiple proteins of the 
same structural class using the 
<a href="http://www.rfcgr.mrc.ac.uk/Registered/Help/stamp/stamp.html">STAMP</a>
program, courtesy of R.B. Russell and G.J. Barton.
By utilizing the graphical features of VMD, 
(i.e. 3D OpenGL Display, Graphical Representations), 
and its own features, (i.e. Sequence Display, Molecule Coloring, 
Residue Selection, and Phylogenetic Tree), 
Multiple alignment explores the sequence and structure of multiple 
aligned proteins concurrently.  The plugin was created primarily to meet 
the research needs of biomedical scientists desiring 
"to study the evolutionary changes in sequence and structure of 
proteins across all three domains of life."

<b>Please note:</b>
<br>
This tool is designed for evolutionary analysis on a single protein domain. 
You may be able to to compare multi-domain proteins provided chain A is 
similar in all structures. Please be aware that attempting to align dissimilar
structures or multichain proteins may cause the alignment procedure to hang, 
and eventually fail.

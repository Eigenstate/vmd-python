\section{Edit Menu}

Along with the copy/cut/paste options that you expect to see in an edit
menu, this menu also provides a power sequence editor.

If you want to edit a sequence, \textsf{Enable Editing}.  If you are
just wanting to align sequences, you can probably choose to just enable
gap editing.  Once you have enabled editing, you can then use the mouse
to choose a residue (or residues).  Hit the space bar to insert a gap,
or, if you have enabled full editing, you can insert a residue by typing
the desired character.

If you want to truly edit the sequences manually, you can choose to
\textsf{Edit In Text Editor}.  VMD's text editor will be loaded, and you
can change the sequence data.  Dashes are gaps and the sequence
characters can be changed as you see fit.

The sequence viewer is used to list the residue sequences of proteins 
and the base sequences of nucleic acids, and to select residues/bases
from the sequence list for highlighting in the 3-D structure in the 
main VMD window. 
When residues are selected in the main VMD window, the corresponding 
residue is highlighted in the sequence list in this form. Color-coded 
protein structure information is displayed for amino-acid residues, 
and B-factor information is displayed for all residues. In this section, 
``residues'' refers both to amino acid residues in proteins, and to 
nucleotide bases with associated backbone in DNA and RNA molecules.

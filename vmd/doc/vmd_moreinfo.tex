\section{For information on our other software}

\VMD\ is part of a suite of tools developed by the 
Theoretical and Computational Biophysics group at the University of Illinois. 

\begin{itemize}
\LISTITEM{\BIOCORE}\index{BioCoRE} 
BioCoRE is a web-based collaborative environment for structural biology
which provides tools to allow collaboration between researchers down the
hall or around the world.  Anyone with access to the internet and a
standard web browser can join BioCoRE and create or be added to research
projects, and information about a particular project is shared among all
members of that project.  More information is available at the 
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{BioCoRE home page}{http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/biocore}

\LISTITEM{\NAMD}\index{NAMD} 
A parallel, object-oriented molecular
dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large
biomolecular systems.
\NAMD\ uses the CHARMM\mycite{}{} force field and file formats compatible
with both CHARMM and X-PLOR\mycite{}{}.
\NAMD\ supports both periodic and non-periodic boundaries with
efficient full electrostatics, multiple timestepping, constant
pressure and temperature ensemble simulation methods.
More information is available at the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{NAMD home page}{http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Researach/namd}

%% \LISTITEM{\JMV}\index{JMV}
%% JMV is an easy-to-use Java-based molecular viewer which uses Java3D to 
%% provide hardware accelerated rendering of molecules.  
%% JMV is designed as component software,
%% and can be used within other programs, or as a standalone application.  
%% More information is available at the
%% \htmladdnormallinkfoot{JMV home page}{http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/jmv}

\LISTITEM{\MDTOOLS}\index{MDTools}
MDTools is a collection of programs, scripts, and utilities provided 
for researchers to make various modeling and simulation tasks easier. 
More information is available at the
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{MDTools home page}{http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/MDTools}

%% \LISTITEM{Structural Biology Software Database}\index{Structural Biology Software Database} 
%% The database contains programs which are of interest to researchers in 
%% structural biology, quantum chemistry, and bioinformatics.  
%% The database entries are contributed by users, and are moderated to provide 
%% a high quality resource.  
%% More information is available at the
%% \htmladdnormallinkfoot{Structural Biology Software Database home page}{http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/biosoftdb/}

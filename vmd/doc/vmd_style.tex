\section{Document style conventions}

\begin{enumerate}

\BOLDLISTITEM{Object Classes}
All object class names are indicated with a \OBJ{typewriter}
font, and begin with a capital letter, i.e.,
\begin{center}
  \OBJ{CommandQueue}
\end{center}

\BOLDLISTITEM{Function Names}
All function names begin with a lower case letter and are indicated
with a {\tt typewriter} font, with the return type in {\bf bold} font;
arguments are specified with the type in {\bf bold} font, and the name
in {\it italics}, i.e.,
\begin{center}
  \FN{char *}{stringdup}{\FA{char *}{s}}
\end{center}
When described specifically as a member function of a particular
class, the class name is prepended, i.e.,
\begin{center}
  \FNO{Displayable}{void}{pick}{void *}
\end{center}
Unless otherwise specified, functions with no arguments given are
assumed to have no arguments, and specify {\bf void} in their
function prototype.

\end{enumerate}

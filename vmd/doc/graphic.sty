%  ________________________________________________________
%     PICT and EPSF graphics macro set  (based on LaTeX)

%  manual:
%  =======
% 
%  This macro file defines the following 4 graphic macros for PICT and EPSF
%  graphics. It uses macro file epsf.sty. Note, EPSF pictures that do not 
%  include a Mac preview are not displayed on a Macintosh screen but are printed. 
%  PICT graphics can only be used on a Macintosh. Type \pictfalse if you like to
%  exclude all PICT images. \includepicttrue is default.
%
%  !!! Don't forget the blanks between the arguments !!!
%
%  \pict:
%  ------
%
%    display PICT formated data out of the <name>.tex.picture in a vbox
%    __________________________________________________________________
%
%    \pict <height> by <width> (<name> scaled <scale>)
%
%    <comand> comand to be used when placing the picture
%    <name>   name of the picture in the TeX-Scrapbook
%    <scale>  scale times 1000 to rescale the picture (optional)
%             it also scales <height> and <width>
%
%
%  \displaypict:
%  -------------
%
%    display PICT formated data out of the <name>.tex.picture as a figure
%    ____________________________________________________________________
%
%    \pict[<floatcode>] <height> by <width> (<name> scaled <scale>) {<internals>}
%
%    <floatcode> code to determine preferences for positioning floating objects (optional) 
%    <name>      name of the picture in the TeX-Scrapbook
%    <scale>     scale times 1000 to rescale the picture  (optional)
%                it also scales <height> and <width>
%    <internals> caption cammand, label command, etc. (may be empty)
%
%
%  \epsf:
%  ------
%
%    display EPSF formated data from a file called <name> in a vbox
%    ______________________________________________________________
%
%    \epsf <height> by <width> (<name> scaled <scale>)
%
%    <comand> comand to be used when placing the picture
%    <name>   path and name of the EPSF-file where picture is strored in
%    <scale>  scale times 1000 to rescale the picture (optional)
%             it also scales <height> and <width>
%    <height> by <width>  (optional)
%
%  \displayepsf:
%  -------------
%
%    display EPSF formated data from a file called <name> as a figure
%    ________________________________________________________________
%
%    \displayepsf[<floatcode>] <height> by <width> (<name> scaled <scale>) {<internals>}
%
%    <floatcode> code to determine preferences for positioning floating objects
%    <comand>    comand to be used when placing the picture
%    <name>      path and name of the EPSF-file where picture is strored in
%    <scale>     scale times 1000 to rescale the picture
%                it also scales <height> and <width>
%    <internals> caption command, label command, etc.
%
%
%  usage:
%  ------
%
%  To use these macros type into your document:
%
%  \input {graphic.sty}               or
%  \documentstyle[...,graphic,...]

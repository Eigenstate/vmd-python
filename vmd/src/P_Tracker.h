 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This is Paul's new Tracker code -- pgrayson@ks.uiuc.edu
 *
 * An object representing a connection to a machine that controls 3d
 * input devices (optionally with buttons, force-feedback, etc). One
 * connection may control one or many devices, so there needs to be a
 * global list of trackers which the Sensors peruse when first being
 * initialized.

/**
 * Common notes for VMDTracker, Feedback, and Buttons classes, collectively
 * referred to as devices in what follows.
 *
 * Constructor: The constructor must not require any input arguments.  The
 * reason for this is that an instance of every class is created and held
 * in an associative store so that it can be referenced by its device_name()
 * string.  This instantiation is done independently of any device 
 * configuration, such as what would be found in the .vmdsensors file.  
 * Constructors should thus do nothing but initialize member data to NULL or
 * default values.
 *
 * device_name(): This pure virtual function supplies a string by which the
 * device can be accessed in an associative store (since classes aren't
 * first-class objects in C++).  The name must be unique to that class,
 * among all devices of that type.
 *
 * clone(): This should do nothing more that return an instance of
 * the class.
 *
 * do_start(const SensorConfig *): Here's where the action is: This method
 * will be called from the base class start() method after general 
 * initialization is done.  This method is where the subclass should,
 * e.g., establish a connection to a remote device.  If there is no
 * class-specific initialization to do then the subclass need not override
 * this method.
 *
 * start() should be called only once in a device's life, when it is first
 * added to a Tool.

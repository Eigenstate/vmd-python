 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * A Pickable object is one which contains data which may be selected by
 * using a pointer device in an open DisplayDevice.  Each Pickable registers
 * itself with a PickList object which indicates it has items in its
 * drawing list which may be picked, and which indicates it should be told
 * when something has been successfully selected.  There are one or many
 * picking modes, which are represented by derivations of the PickMode class.
 * When picking is done, it is done while in a current pick mode, which
 * controls what to do with the information.
 *
 * A Pickable must provide versions of virtual routines which tell what
 * pick modes the object is interested in.

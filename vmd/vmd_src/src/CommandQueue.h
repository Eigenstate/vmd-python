 ***************************************************************************
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * 
 * This stores all the Commands to be run in a queue.  The idea is that
 * the various events add Commands to the command queue then they
 * are read off the queue and the UIs are notified.
 *
 * There is one global instance of this class in VMDApp, called commandQueue.
 * It is used by all the user interface objects (UIObject classes).
 * Each time a new action is requested by the user or some other part of
 * VMD, a new Command instance is created and added to the
 * CommandQueue.  Within the main event loop of VMD, after each
 * UIObject is checked for new events, the commands in the queue are
 * all executed until the queue is empty (since the execution of one command
 * may result in the queuing of a new command, this process continues until
 * the queue is empty).
 *
 * NOTES:
 *  1) To add new commands to queue, use routine 'append(Command *)',
 *     inherited since this is a ResizeArray<> object.
 *  2) To do something, use 'execute' routine. 
 *     This will execute the top command and inform all the UIs 
 *  3) 'execute_all' will do all the commands until the queue is empty.

\section{Description of each \VMD\ window}
\label{ug:ui:windows}

\VMD\ uses several different GUI windows, each designed to control a specific
aspect of the molecular display (e.g., to control the appearance of the
graphics display window, or to change the colors of displayed objects). The
following sections give a brief description of the windows available in \VMD; 
the remaining chapters in this manual describe the actions which these 
windows make available in greater detail.

\chapter{User Interface Components}
\label{chapter:ug:uis}

\VMD\ provides several methods for the user to control and
interact with the molecular display.  The primary methods are by using the
mouse, either in the graphics window or in the different graphical user 
interface (GUI) {\em forms} provided by the program.  
In addition to the mouse, \VMD\ also supports a number of more advanced 
input devices such as the Spaceball, Magellan, and Phantom, 
which provide the ability to manipulate molecules with six degrees of freedom.
Some devices such as the Phantom can also provide haptic (sense of touch) 
force feedback.
\VMD\ also provides a text console interface for executing built-in commands 
or running scripts.  
This chapter describes how to use the mouse-based user interfaces, 
and some of the advanced input devices supported in VMD. 
The the text and scripting interface is described fully in 
chapter \ref{chapter:ug:text}.

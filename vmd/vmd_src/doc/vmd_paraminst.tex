\begin{itemize}
  \TTLISTITEM{INSTALLBINDIR (default=/usr/local/bin)}
The directory where scripts
and utility programs are installed.  This should be a directory which
is in the path of all users interested in running \VMD.

  \TTLISTITEM{INSTALLLIBDIR (default=/usr/local/lib/vmd)}
A directory in which \VMD\ data
files and architecture-specific executables are placed.  This
directory should {\em not} be in the path of users running \VMD.

  \TTLISTITEM{INSTALLNAME (default=vmd)}
\VMD\ uses a shell script to run the proper \VMD\ executable for the given version of Unix (the
script also sets some environment variables and starts an {\tt
xterm} running to act as the \VMD\ console).  {\tt INSTALLNAME}
is the name given to this shell script, and will be the command users
type to run \VMD.  When the program is
installed, the file {\tt bin/vmd} is then copied to the file
{\tt INSTALLBINDIR/INSTALLNAME}.

\end{itemize}

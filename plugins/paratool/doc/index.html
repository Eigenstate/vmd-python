<h3>Easy generation of force field parameters</h3>
<p>
Paratool provides a graphical interface for force field parametrizations of
molecules that are not contained in your force field. It is designed
to generate CHARMM or AMBER compliant parameters (while it is more 
specialized on CHARMM).
</p>
<p>
The plugin helps you to generate the molecule or the moleular fragment
that should be parametrized and to set up the necessary
quantumchemical calculations (you'll need Gaussian, later versions
will also support GAMESS). 
Paratool reads the logfiles of the QM simulations, computes force
field parameters for bonds, angles dihedrals and impropers by
transforming the Hessian into internal coordinates and converting all
values into units based on kcal/mol, &Aring; and degrees. You can
assign atom types and the corresponding VDW parameters from a list of
already existing types or generates new types (all chemical elements
H - Rn supported). The charges can be determined using restricted
electrostatic potential fitting RESP (AMBER style) or CHARMM style
charges using their supramolecular approach which requires another
Gaussian calculation.
</p>
<p>
Paratool generates input for all necessary external programs collects
and compiles all the necessary data, organizes and displays them
neatly in lists and projects them onto your molecule in VMD. Finally 
it will write the topology and parameter files you'll need to build
the molecule using psfgen and run your simulation in your favourite
simulation package, e.g. NAMD.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
Even though Paratool simplifies force field parametrization a lot
you'll still need to know what you are doing.
We are currently preparing a manuscript that will give a detailed
overview over the complete force field parametrization process. Please
check back! 
</p>
<p>
<a href="usersguide.html">Paratool's user guide</a> is a practical guide
through the parametrization procedure but also also contains a
reasonable amount of background information.

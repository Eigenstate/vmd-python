<h2>General Parametrization Strategies for CHARMM and AMBER</h2>
The parametrization schemes for CHARMM, AMBER and many other force
fields are quite similar with regard to the bonded interactions while
greater differences can be found in the derivation of charges. 

Typically force fields are parametrized against a combination of
experimental and quantumchemical target data, i.e. properties of a
molecule that the force field should be able to reproduce. Examples
are equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies or dipole moments.
In comparison CHARMM relies somewhat more on experimental values
while AMBER utilizes a reasonable amount of quantumchemically
determined values.
The equilibrium geometries for the compounds are typically obtained
from X-ray crystal structures and for gas phase structures from
microwave and electron diffraction data. Force constants can be
determined using vibrational frequencies from infrared and Raman
spectroscopy. Whenever it is needed supplemental data can be generated
by quantum mechanical calculations.

The treatment of charges differs significantly among
force fields. In CHARMM they are based on Mulliken charges which are
scaled in a way such that the interaction of polar groups with TIP3
water reproduces the interaction energy computed <i>ab initio</i>.
For AMBER a method called RESP (restricted electrostatic potential
fitting) is used <a href="usersguide.html#CORN93"[2]: Atom centered point charges are
fitted applying certain restrictions such as to reproduce the
molecular electrostatic potential on a number of shells around the
molecule. Once an initial set of parameters has been generated, the
intra- and intermolecular parameters are alternatingly optimized with
respect to quantum chemical and experimental data in a selfconsistent,
iterative manner until convergence.

The degree to which one follows these protocols and the amount of
effort one invests into the development of parameters for a novel
component depends on the purpose for what they should be used. In case
an organic ligand just needs to fill a binding pocket in the right
conformation an abbreviated protocol might be sufficient. However
parameters valid for accurate binding free energy calculations will
require much more tuning and testing. PARATOOL aids generating the
basic set of parameters that the user might then test against his
target data such as conformational stability in simulations or
vibrational frequencies.

    <h3>Background and Scope</h3>
    <p>The <b>signalproc</b> plugin is a collection of scripted and compiled
      Tcl plugins that can be of use for "signal processing" and related 
      types of applications within VMD. To load <b>all</b> packages of this
      collection in one go you can use:</p>
    <pre>
    package require signalproc
    </pre>

    <h4>specden - Calculation of Spectral Densities (v1.1).</h4>
    <p>This plugin is the heart of the <a href="../irspecgui/">IRSpecGUI</a> tool.
      It allows to compute spectral densities from trajectories using time series data.
      By computing the Fourier transformed auto-correlated data directly. This method
      has the advantage over the more traditional way of first computing an auto-correlation
      function (ACF) and then performing the fourier transform, that it is frequently faster
      (O (N log(N)) instead of O(N^2)), especially if only lower frequency information is
      required, and doesn't require to cut off the intermediate ACF arbitrarily.
      On top of that i can renormalize the resulting power spectrum with frequency
      dependent prefactors based on a number of different models.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the GUI using the low level <tt>specden</tt> command direcly, allows to process
      for much more flexible auto-correlation data calculations. 
      <a href="#specden_examples">Below</a> are a few example application scripts. 
    </p>

    <h5>Syntax</h5>
    The <tt>specden</tt> command is individually added to the Tcl script interpreter through:
    <pre>
    package require specden
    </pre>
    And used as <tt>specden &lt;x-,y-,z-data&gt; &lt;deta t&gt; &lt;max. freq&gt; ?&lt;norm&gt;? ?&lt;temp&gt;? ?&lt;oversamp&gt;?</tt> for example like this:
<pre>
    specden $dat 10.0 3000.0 harmonic 300.0
</pre>
    <p>The individual arguments are:
    <table>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">&lt;x-,y-,z-data&gt;</td>
          <td>This is a list of lists of xyx-triples, which can be any data like 
            dipole moment vectors, velocities, positions, etc. for one-, or two-dimensional
            data sets, the missing entries can be padded with zeroes.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top">&lt;max. freq&gt;</td>
          <td>Largest frequency to be considered in the calculation in wavenumbers (cm^-1).
            The maximum allowed value depends on the size of the data set. Using a smaller

	src="smooth.png" align="right"></a>
    <h4>sgsmooth - Savitzky-Golay Data Smoothing and Numerical Derivative Calculation (v1.1)</h4>
    <p>The Savitzky-Golay method performs some kind of improved slinding window averaging
      filter by what comes down to effectively a local polynomial regression (of degree k) 
      on a distribution of points. In a variant of this filter, the polynomial can be used 
      to perform a calculation of a numerical derivative.<p>

    <p>The main advantage of this approach is, that with a proper choice of parameters, 
      it tends to preserve features of the original data distribution such as relative maxima, 
      minima, width and the integral, which are usually 'flattened' by other adjacent 
      averaging techniques (like sliding window averages, for example). Very good results
      are achieved with already quite low order polynomial (4th-8th) and moderate 
      window sizes. See graph on the right for an example. Note that the actual window
      size is twice the number of polynomial bins plus one, i.e. 21 in the example.
    </p>

    <h5>Syntax</h5>
    The <tt>sgsmooth</tt> and <tt>sgsderiv</tt> commands are individually added to the Tcl script 
    interpreter through:
    <pre>
    package require sgsmooth
    </pre>
    And used as <tt>sgsmooth &lt;data&gt; &lt;window&gt; &lt;order&gt;</tt> and  
    <tt>sgsderiv &lt;data&gt; &lt;window&gt; &lt;order&gt;</tt>.
    <p>The individual arguments in both cases are:
    <table>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">&lt;data&gt;</td>
          <td>This is a list floating point numbers. The data points are assumed to be equidistant.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">&lt;window&gt;</td>
          <td>This is the sliding average window size parameter. The total number of data points
            used to generated the smoothed number is twice the window size plus one.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">&lt;order&gt;</td>
          <td>This is the order of the polynomial that is being used to generate the windowing function.</td>
        </tr>
   </table>
      <p><tt>sgsmooth</tt> will return a smoothed version of the list of data points that have
      been given as input, <tt>sgsderiv</tt> its first derivative.</p>

    <h4>fftpack - 1d, 2d, 3d, and 4d Fast Fourier Transforms (v1.1)</h4>
    <p>This plugin provides a Tcl script interface to one and multi-dimensional Fourier 
      transforms adapted from the <a href="http://kissfft.sf.net">Kiss FFT</a>
      package, a small, portable and fairly efficient FFT library with a BSD type license.
      This package can be used to do Fourier analysis or synthesis on data and 
      other convolutions or filtering of data sets. The code provides complex to complex
      transforms for one to four dimensional data. For 1d data sets also complex-to-real
      and real-to-complex transforms are supported.</p>

    <h5>Syntax</h5>
    The the fftpack commands are individually added to the Tcl script interpreter through:
    <pre>
    package require fftpack
    </pre>
    The take lists of numbers as arguments and return the fourier transformed data.
    Complex numbers are represented as list of two read numbers. If a command expects
    a list of complex numbers, but only a list of real is given, the missing imaginary
    part will automatically be added.

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <a name="specden_examples"></a>
    <h4>Spectral Densities Plugin Examples</h4>
    <h5>Example 1: data from external file</h5>
    We assume the data file has its information in columns (here: CPMD style ENERGIES files)
    and we want to compute the power spectrum of column two for a pair of files and 
    plot them using the multiplot plugin to compare them.
<pre>
    # compare effect of fictitious mass on fictitious vibronic DOS in CP dynamics
    package require specden
    package require multiplot

    set fp [open "ENERGIES-cp-200au" "r"]
    set dlist {}
    while { [gets $fp dat] >= 0 } {
        lappend dlist [list [lindex $dat 1] 0.0 0.0]
    }
    close $fp
    lassign [specden $dlist 4.0 20000.0] flist slist
    set ph [multiplot -x $flist -y $slist -title "EKINC Power Spectrum" -lines -linewidth 3 -marker points -plot]

    set fp [open "ENERGIES-cp-400au" "r"]
    set dlist {}
    while { [gets $fp dat] >= 0 } {
        lappend dlist [list [lindex $dat 1] 0.0 0.0]
    }
    lassign [specden $dlist 4.0 20000.0] flist slist
    close $fp
    $ph add $flist $slist -lines -linecolor red -linewidth 3 -plot 
</pre>

    <h5>Example 2: Position auto-correlation</h5>
    We want to compute the power spectrum of all H labeled atoms from a position 
    auto-correlation function (works the same way for velocity auto-correlation
    functions, if your trajectory file contains velocities instead of positions).
    This example works in text mode and the output is a file with the individual
    spectra as columns and an averaged spectrum as the last column.
<pre>
    # calculate power spectrum from position auto-correlation of hydrogen atoms
    package require specden

    set mol [mol new {h2o.psf} waitfor all]
    mol addfile {TRAJEC-cp-200.xyz} waitfor all

    set sel [atomselect $mol {name H}]
    set nf [molinfo $mol get numframes]
    set na [$sel num]

    set reslist {}
    for {set a 0} {$a < $na} {incr a} {
        set dlist {}
        for {set f 0} {$f < $nf} {incr f} {
            $sel frame $f
            lappend dlist [lindex [$sel get {x y z}] $a]
        }
        lassign [specden $dlist 400.0 3000.0 harm 330.0 1] flist slist
        lappend reslist $slist
    }

    # write out the result as: fequency, h1, h2, ..., <h>
    set fp [open "posacfspec-h.dat" "w"]
    set ns [llength $flist]
    for {set i 0} {$i < $ns} {incr i} {
        puts -nonewline $fp "[lindex $flist $i] "
        set avg 0.0
        for {set a 0} {$a < $na} {incr a} {
            set val [lindex $reslist $a $i]
            puts -nonewline $fp "$val "
            set avg [expr {$avg + $val}]
        }
        puts $fp "[expr $avg / $na]"
    }
    close $fp
</pre>

    <h3>Parallelization</h3>
    <p> If compiled from source, <a href="#specden">specden</a>, <b>sgsmooth</b>, and <b>fftpack</b> can 
      all be compiled with multi-threading support via the 
      <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">OpenMP</a> parallel programming interface.
      The number of threads can then be controlled by either the usual <b>OMP_NUM_THREADS</b>
      environment variable, or using the VMD internal <b>VMDFORCECPUCOUNT</b> environment
      variable. The latter will overrided the former.
      <i>Note:</i> Due to portability issues, the precompiled VMD binaries shipped from
      the VMD homepage, are currently (Version 1.8.7) <b>not</b> compiled with OpenMP support.

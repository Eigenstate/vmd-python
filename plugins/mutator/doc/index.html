<p>
This plugin provides a very simple method for mutating a target
residue selected by its segment name and id, and the three character
residue code for the mutant amino acid. It can also build,  for the
specific purpose of free energy calculations, a hybrid structure where
both the initial and mutated side chains are present.
<br>
</p>


<h3>Normal operation</h3>
<p>
The plugin takes in psf and pdb files containing your protein (if you
are not familiar with psf files, check out the 
<a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/autopsf/">autopsf plugin</a>
or the 
<a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/">namd tutorial</a>),
the segment name and ID of the specific residue to be mutated (if you
want to mutate residue 4 of segment DA in your protein, then Segment
would be "DA" and ID would be "4"), and the final mutation (lets say
you want to replace the amino acid at position 4 by tyrosine, then the
three letter residue name for the mutation would be TYR). The mutated
protein will be saved by default in files called "MUTATED.pdb" and
"MUTATED.psf" on your working directory. If a segment is not
specified, then the mutation will be performed on all protein segments
of the system (note that mutator is able to handle systems that
already include membrane, ions, and water).
</p>


<h4>Caveats</h4>
<p>
Mutator does not support DNA. Patches are supported provided they 
are listed in the REMARKS section of the input psf file.
Since coordinates for the mutated amino-acid are
assigned based on internal coordinates provided in standard CHARMM
topology files, it is strongly recommended to perform an energy
minimization on the resulting structure.
</p>

<h3>Making a hybrid with the FEP option</h3>
<p>
The FEP option is used in the
specific case where you wish to study the thermodynamic impact of the
mutation through free energy calculations with NAMD. This can be done
using the 
<a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/2.6b1/ug/node35.html">alchemical Free Energy Perturbation</a>
(FEP) code. For alchemical FEP, you need a hybrid structure where both
the original and the mutated amino acid side chains are present. When
run with the FEP option, Mutator produces the files required for such
a calculation. These include a fepFile and a PSF file modified to
exclude all interactions between the original amino acid side chain
and the mutated one.
</p>

<h4>Caveats for the FEP option</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Because of atom name changes, patches that modify the side
      chains cannot be used with the provided hybrid topologies. Standard
      patches for the termini should work fine, although it is always
      advisable to carefully inspect the resulting structure.
  </li>
  <li>In the particular case of glycine, the alpha carbon atom has to
      be modified in the transformation. For that reason, most patches will
      probably cause problems. Also, mutating a glycine will cause some
      angle and dihedral parameters to be duplicated, possibly modifying
      backbone conformational preferences. In short, do not mutate a residue
      from or to glycine unless you know what you are doing.
  </li>
  <li>Since proline has a special structure (and is actually not an 
      amino acid), hybrids involving proline are not supported.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If the PSF produced by Mutator/FEP is further processed (by
      psfgen, solvate, ionize, etc.), the non bonded exclusion lists are
      likely to be lost. The resulting PSF should then be <a
      href="http://www.edam.uhp-nancy.fr/Alchemify/">alchemified</a> again
      to add these lists back.
  </li>
</ul>

<!--#set var="TITLE" value="DX Plugin, Version 1.9"-->
<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

<p>This plugin reads potential maps stored in 
<a href=http://opendx.npaci.edu/docs/html/>Data Explorerer "DX"</a> 
format used by 
<a href="http://agave.wustl.edu/apbs/">APBS</a>. 
It may not read DX-format files produced by other applications, 
though this could change in the future.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Read-only</b>
<br>This plugin is used only to read files. VMD does not currently support
writing this file type.</p>

<p><b>Unit Cell</b>
<br>All files are assumed to have an orthogonal unit cell.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>
<pre>
   DX potential maps
  
   Format of the file is:
   # Comments
   .
   .
   .
   object 1 class gridpositions counts xn yn zn
   origin xorg yorg zorg
   delta xdel 0 0
   delta 0 ydel 0
   delta 0 0 zdel
   object 2 class gridconnections counts xn yn zn
   object 3 class array type double rank 0 items [ xn*yn*zn ] data follows
   f1 f2 f3
   f4 f5 f6
   .
   .
   .
   object "Dataset name" class field
  
   Where xn, yn, and zn are the number of data points along each axis;
   xorg, yorg, and zorg is the origin of the grid, in angstroms;
   xdel, ydel, and zdel are the scaling factors to convert grid units to
   angstroms.
   Grid data follows, with three values per line, ordered z fast, y medium,
   and x slow.
  
   Note: this plugin was written to read the OpenDX files created by the
   APBS program, and doesn't support all of the features in the file format.

<!--#set var="TITLE" value="PQR Plugin, Version 0.6"-->
<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

<p>This plugin reads and writes molecular coordinate data stored in the PQR
file format. This variant of the PDB format contains atom charge and radius
information, and does not store many of fields found in PDB files.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
The PQR files written by this plugin currently contain the same radius and
charge information used for VMD's internal atom representation. Since this
may not be appropriate for some applications, it may be necessary to
override these values in VMD using atomselect commands. Consult the VMD
User's Guide for information on changing atom data using atomselections.

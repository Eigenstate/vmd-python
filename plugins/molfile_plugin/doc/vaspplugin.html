<a href="http://www.uni-ulm.de/~ssakong/vmdplugins">VASP plugins</a>
are developed to read 
<a href="http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/">VASP input/output files</a>
and display atomic/charge configurations/trajectories in VMD.

<p>
What can I do with VASP plugins?

<p>
If you are VASP user and tired to use converting scripts output data 
to pdb and xyz format to visualize it, then VASP plugins for VMD 
natively handles following file formats:
<ul>
<li>vasprun.xml/OUTCAR : Plot trajectory of each ionic steps.
<li>POSCAR/CONTCAR : Display atomic configuration.
<li>XDATCAR : Plot trajectory of each ionic step.
<li>CHGCAR/LOCPOT/ELFCAR/PARCHG : Display isosurfaces of charge density 
    and electron localization function (ELF).
</ul>

<h3>Known bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Occassionally OUTCAR read plugin has problems recognizing atom types.
I am using atomic mass to recognize the type of atom, but POTCAR files 
contain POMASS values which is somewhat different from widely used
atomic mass. I cannot match each atom type between periodic_table.h
and POTCARs. Thus, I set a margin of 0.01 for atomic mass recognition 
routine. It works for most of atoms, however in several POTCARs the 
margin is not sufficient.
<li>I found that file structure of vasprun.xml is frequently changed. I am 
not so sure whether xml read plugin will work with next version VASP, 
or not.
</ul>

<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Memory leak is fixed. Common data structure for VASP data is designed 
    by Rob Lahaye. (June 29, 2006)
<li>CHGCAR plugin reads spin polarized charge again. (May 18, 2006)
<li>VMD can save the coordinates in POSCAR. (May 17, 2006)
<li>Plugins for VMD 1.8.4 are ready. I thank Rob Lahaye <lahaye at skku.edu> 
    for many debugging and good advices. (May 15, 2006)
<li>CHGCAR plugin reads 3d-mesh properly. (April 27, 2006)
</ul>

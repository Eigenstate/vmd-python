<p>
This plugin reads text mode LAMMPS trajectory files (aka dumps) in
atom style or custom style. Not all fields of the custom style
output are supported in the molfile API and thus cannot be
communicated directly to VMD. Also the file format itself allows
for a variable number of atoms which VMD currently cannot handle.
Therefore the plugin will stop reading any trajectory file
with an error message at the first frame that has a different
number of atoms compared the previous ones.</p>

<p>
A brief summary of the "atom" LAMMPS trajectory 
<a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/dump.html">dump</a> format
for orthorhombic boxes is below. LAMMPS also supports a
"custom" dump style that is very similar to the "atom" style,
but it allows to output a custom selection of a large variety 
of per-atom properties, including data created by "fix"es
or "compute"s.  Upon writing VMD will currently only write
"atom" style dump files.</p>

<p>The characters following the BOX BOUNDS keyword indicate the 
boundary conditions for each side in x-, y-, and z-direction respectively.
'p' stands for periodic boundaries, but also 'f' (=fixed), 's' (=shrinkwrap),
and 'm' (=shrinkwrap with minimum) are possible or combinations 
thereof. When writing LAMMPS dumps, periodic boundaries are assumed
if non-zero box dimensions are given; if not, then shrinkwrap
is assumed and the corresponding lo-/hi-values are determined by 
the plugin.</p>

<p>Coordinates can be given in different variants: regular or
as fractional coordinates (indicated by the postfix 's'). Similarly
can they be output as wrapped back into the principal unitcell
or unwrapped (indicated by the postfix 'u'). In addition to 
wrapped coordinates, also the image flags ('ix', 'iy', 'iz')
that are counters for how many times an atom has passed through
the cell in the respective direction. In "atom" style dumps, the 
<a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/dump_modify.html">dump_modify</a>
command in LAMMPS can be used to change the output format.
Multiple coordinate representations can be present in "custom" style 
dumps. The lammpsplugin will make the best effort to reconstruct 
unscaled (=regular) and unwrapped coordinates from the available 
information and the simulation cell dimension information.</p>

<p>If the BOX BOUNDS line also optionally contains the 'xy yz yz'
flags, then the box is no longer orthorhombic and the corresponding
'tilt factors' are written out in a 3rd column of numbers in the
following three lines with the box boundaries. The plugin </p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Triclinic Cells</b>
<p>Support for automatic unscaling and unwrapping of coordinates
from simulations using triclinic cells is currently not supported.</p>

<p><b>Unused Data</b>
<p>This plugin only reads from the available data what is compatible
with the molfile plugin API. Also in keeping with the plugin API only
coordinates and velocities are read in for every frame; all other 
properties are taken from the very first frame. Any additional data 
recorded for an atom is ignored, unless the environment variable
LAMMPSREMAPFIELDS is used to replace a supported property with an
unsupported one. For details see below.</p>

<p><b>Legacy LAMMPS Dump Files</b>
<p>The LAMMPS dump file format described above corresponds to recent
versions of LAMMPS. It has been incrementally improved over the years.
Older versions may not provide all the detail. The plugin will make 
a best effort to guess missing information, but that may not always 
produce the desired result.</p>

<p><b>Environment Variables</b>
<p>
Some aspects of the behavior of the plugin can be controlled 
through environment variables, that can be set either externally 
before launching VMD or from the VMD console via manipulation of
the <tt>env</tt> array (use "global env;" to access it in a subroutine).</p>

<b>LAMMPSDIPOLE2ATOMS</b>
<p>With this environment variable set to a number > 0.0 any point dipolar
particle will be converted into two particles a certain distance away
from the center and thus signifying the direction of the dipole. The
numerical value of the LAMMPSDIPOLE2ATOMS environment variable is 
interpreted as a scaling factor for this conversion with respect to
the magnitude of the dipole moment.
</p>
<b>LAMMPSREMAPFIELDS</b>
<p>
This environment variable allows to map certain columns in a LAMMPS
trajectory file to others and thus allows to read in properies, which
VMD is normally not able to read. The content of the variable
is the list of mappings in the format <code>old=new</code> and 
separated by commas. For example to read in forces into the velocities
fields, the following mapping is required: <code>vx=fx,vy=fy,vz=fz</code>.
This approach can be applied to any data in the dump file, even the 
output from variables, fixes, or computes.

Only the fields for coordinates and velocities will be read and
stored in every time step and thus a suitable to transferring 
per timestep data into VMD through this mechanism. In addition
VMD will read in the fields name, type, mass, radius/diameter, 
and charge and thus those can also be remapped, but those will
only be read in on the first timestep.

<p>This plugin reads and displays GRASP binary surface files 
This format uses triangles exclusively to to represent 3-D geometry. 
Short documents describing the GRASP surface file format can
be found at these two sites:
<li><a href="http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/local/programs/grasp/html/Appendix%20A.html">http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/local/programs/grasp/html/Appendix%20A.html</a>.

</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
Since GRASP surface files are a 'finished product' type of data,
they can't be manipulated very much within VMD, though they can be
displayed.

<p><b>Unused data</b>
At present, the plugin doesn't provide color data from 
the GRASP surface file, the surface is loaded using the active
user-defined graphics drawing color.

<!--#set var="TITLE" value="WebPDB Plugin, Version 1.15"-->
<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

<p>This plugin automatically downloads PDB structures over the web,
   and loads them into VMD.  Structures are specified by their 
   four-letter PDB accession code.

<p>This plugin depends on Tcl in order to run.  On MacOS X and
   Windows this means that the plugin must be able to find the
   dyanmic link libraries for Tcl by automatic means.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p><b>PDB Format</b>
This plugin shares the same behavior and limitations with the
standard <a href="pdbplugin.html">PDB Plugin</a>.

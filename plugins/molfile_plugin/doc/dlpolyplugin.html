<p>
This plugin reads formatted DLPOLY HISTORY (trajectory) files, 
a minimalistic plain text format for storing molecular coordinate trajectories. 
This plugin can't read binary history files, and may not handle all 
variants yet but should work for the most common files.

<p>
The DLPOLY formatted HISTORY file spcecification 
<a href="http://hidra.iqfr.csic.es/man/dlpoly/USRMAN/node156.html">is available here</a>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Periodic Cell Data</b>
The plugin will read periodic cell information from the DLPOLY history file
as long as the cell basis vectors are orthogonal.  The plugin doesn't presently
convert non-orthogonal DLPOLY unit cell basis vectors to alpha/beta/gamma
cell angles.
</p>

<p><b>Unused Data</b>
<br>
This plugin only reads the index and coordinates for each atom. Any
additional data recorded for an atom is ignored presently.

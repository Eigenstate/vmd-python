Bendix is a user-friendly, multi-platform and free plugin for VMD, 
that makes it easier to characterize proteins. It allows you to calculate 
and visualize both dynamic and static helix geometry, and abstracts 
helices without sacrificing conformation. Moreover it accepts both 
coarse-grained and atomistic proteins.

<h3>Intuitive helix representation and geometry analysis</h3>

is a user-friendly, multi-platform and free plugin for VMD,

and visualize both dynamic and static helix geometry, and abstracts

<p>
Bendix displays protein helices as cylinders that follow the helix axis. 
This captures conformational information that is lost if you use classical, 
straight cylinders. Coarse-grained proteins also benefit from beta-sheet 
and backbone display. Helix geometry can be analysed both qualitatively, 
using the revealing heatmap colour-coding, and quantitatively, 
where data is 2D or 3D graphed, with the option to export for viewing 
with common graphing packages. With its multiple settings, 
Bendix is easily tailored.

<p>
Bendix integrates with the rest of VMD, so there is nothing stopping you 
from using Bendix in addition to, say, Graphical Representations. 
For Bendix examples and screenshots, please view the slideshows

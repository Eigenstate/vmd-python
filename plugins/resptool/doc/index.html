<p>This graphical interface for the program RESP makes setting up restricted
electrostatic potential fitting, the standard method of obtaining atom partial charges
for the AMBER force field. Results can be loaded, mapped onto the molecule and
displayed graphically. We recommend that you perform your complete force field 
parametrizations
using <em>Paratool</em> which uses RESPtool as a module.

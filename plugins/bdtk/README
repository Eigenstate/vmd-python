* Compile tools. On OS X use GNU g++, not clang++, as the latter does not understand OpenMP.
	You can use 'brew' to install g++. Tested to work with g++ 4.6.4
	OpenMP significantly speeds up computations of 3-d potential maps

		cd tools
		make
		cd ..


* Add the following code to the very end of your '.vmdrc' file:

	if ![info exists tk_version] return
	set auto_path [linsert $auto_path 0 /local/path/to/PoreExplorer]

	if [catch {package require bdtoolkit} msg] {
			puts "Pore Explorer could not be loaded!"
			puts "Error message:"
      puts "$msg"
	} elseif [catch {menu tk register "PoreExplorer" bdtk} msg] {
			puts "Pore Explorer window could not be created!"
			puts "Error message:"
      puts "$msg"
	}

<A HREF="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/biocore/">BioCoRE</A> can 
interact in ways that makes each program more powerful.  For 
instance, you can <A HREF="#views">share molecular views</A> with 
your collaborators as well as <A HREF="#chat">chat with them</A>, 
all from within VMD.

<P>
BioCoRE enhancements are available from the BioCoRE submenu of the
Extensions menu within VMD.

<P>
<A NAME="login"></A>
<H3>Login</H3> - To use the various BioCoRE enhancements, you must first login
to BioCoRE.  Logging in requires a user account.  You can create
<IMG SRC="loginWindow.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT>
an account via the Login window (click on the Create Account button
and filling out the appropriate information)
or you can 
<a href="https://biocore-s.ks.uiuc.edu/biocore/nonsecure/registration/printUserConsent.do"
>
create an account via the webpages</A>.

With a guest account you can join public projects that other users have created.  
With a full account, not only can you join public projects, but you can create 
your own projects, as well as join other private projects that you have been 
invited to.

<P>
To login to BioCoRE, provide your username and password to the Login
window.  You likely won't need to change the URL of the BioCoRE server.
Once you click 'Log in to BioCoRE' and wait a few seconds, you will
receive a popup box telling you of your success or failure.  

<P><HR>
<P>
After logging in, you can use the other features (described below) of 
BioCoRE from within VMD.

<P>
<A NAME="views"></A>
<H3>Share VMD Views</H3>
<P>
One useful feature is the ability to save and load interesting
molecular views to BioCoRE, so that you or your collaborators can
view them, both now and later.
<IMG SRC="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/biocore/biocorepubsync.gif" align="right">
<P>
From VMD, you can select Extensions | BioCoRE | Share VMD Views, which will
bring up the "Saved States Window" The window provides an interface to allow
users to save VMD states for later retrieval, or to share with others. 

<BR><BR>

From the window, you can load molecules into VMD and modify the view. When you
get it to a representation that you wish to keep, you can save it to BioCoRE
with a name and description. BioCoRE is divided up into <A
HREF="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/biocore/tour/tour_projects.html">projects</A>,
and all others in the project in which you saved the project can see it. They
can load it and see the molecule in the exact same representation and
orientation that you did. They can further modify it, and save their state back,
which you can then view.

<H3>Chat</H3>

<IMG SRC="biocorechat-smaller.gif"><BR>
<P>
Designed to simulate the BioCoRE Control Panel, 'Chat' allows you to
communicate with other members of the BioCoRE projects that you are 
enrolled in.  Selecting Chat will open a chat window.  You can pick
which project you wish to chat in by using the Project menu option.
Type your messages in the text line at the bottom of the window.

<td valign=top>
This plugin provides a complete solution for creating several
simple rotation and trajectory movies for presentations and 
science discussions.  

The plugin automatically handles everything from 
initial rendering of the movie frames, conversion of the 
image file formats, image smoothing, image rescaling, text labelling,
and final compression and encoding of the images as an 
Animated GIF, AVI, MPEG, or Quicktime movie.

<h3>Software Requirements:</h3>
<p>
The movie plugin relies heavily on several platform-dependent 
programs which provide VMD with a means of generating the final movie files.
The features provided by the movie plugin vary by platform, according
to the mechanism used in generating the movies.

<p>
<b>Microsoft Windows</b>
<ul>
<li>POV-Ray 3.6 requires that you check the "No restrictions" for reading
    writing files option, and disable the "single instance" option in 
    the POV-Ray graphical interface so that VMD can execute POV-Ray 
    automatically.
<li>On Windows, the program VideoMach is currently required for all 
    movie generation tasks.  It is a shareware program and is available 
    for trial download from the 
    <a href=http://www.gromada.com/videomach/>VideoMach web site</a>.
    Licenses are $20 or $60 depending on the number of video/image 
    formats you want to use it for.  The $20 license is sufficent
    for VMD.
<li><b>Looking for other movie converters!</b>  We are looking for free
    movie converter packages which can be run on Windows in batch mode
    as is currently possible with VideoMach.  If you know of free movie
    compression programs that work well on Windows, please email 
    vmd@ks.uiuc.edu and let us know so we can add support for them in
    future versions of the movie maker plugin.
</ul>

<p>
<b>MacOS X</b>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href=http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php>Fink package manager</a> on your MacOS X machine.
<li>Run 'fink install netpbm' to get the NetPBM toolkit required by the movie plugin.
<li>Run 'fink install imagemagick-nox' to get ImageMagick, required to create animated GIF movies
<li>When rendering or writing temporary files outside your home
    directory POV-Ray 3.6 requires that you edit ~/povray.conf and
    add lines such as "read+write  /working/directory" in order to 
    be allowed to run POV-Ray and generate files outside your home 
    directory.  You need one "read+write" line for every directory
    tree you want to be able to use.
</ul>


<p>
<b>Unix platforms</b>
<ul>
<li>The NetPBM utilities are used to convert between image file formats
    such as Targa, PPM, BMP, etc.  NetPBM can be downloaded from the 
    <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/netpbm/>NetPBM home page</a>.
    The "ppmtompeg" program included with NetPBM is what is used for 
    MPEG-1 encoding currently.
<li>The ImageMagick utilities are used (specifically, the "convert" program)
    to provide the animated GIF output format.  ImageMagick is available
    from the <a href=http://www.imagemagick.org/>ImageMagick web site</a>.
<li>The SGI "dmconvert" tool is optionally used to provide conversions to
    the MPEG, QuickTime, and SGI Movie formats.  This option is only 
    available on the IRIX platforms.
<li>When rendering or writing temporary files outside your home
    directory POV-Ray 3.6 requires that you edit ~/povray.conf and
    add lines such as "read+write  /working/directory" in order to 
    be allowed to run POV-Ray and generate files outside your home 
    directory.  You need one "read+write" line for every directory
    tree you want to be able to use.
</ul>

<h3>Feature-specific notes:</h3>
The text below provides a few simple suggestions to get best results with 
specific movie making settings, and workarounds for common problems.

<p>
<b>Rendering using "Snapshot":</b>
<br>
Some Windows and Linux OpenGL video drivers behave erratically with
the "snapshot" rendering mode, so it may be necessary to use one of
the ray tracers if you have a video driver that gives "garbled" images
when you use the "snapshot" rendering mode.

<p>
<b>Rendering using "Internal Tachyon" or "Tachyon":</b>
<br>
Since Tachyon is packaged with VMD itself and has been developed
side-by-side with the rendering features in VMD, it is the best choice 
for high quality ray tracing of VMD scenes.  Tachyon is best used for
rendering movies that use ambient occlusion lighting, angle-modulated
transparency, gradient backgrounds, and other features that are
closely tied to specific VMD rendering capabilities not supported 
by other rendering packages.  On versions of VMD that include support
for the "Internal Tachyon" option, this option is the best choice as
it avoids writing large scene files to disk and instead renders the
VMD scene directly from RAM, saving many gigabytes of disk space
and speeding up movie rendering considerably, particularly on fast
multi-core CPUs.


<p>
<b>"User Defined" movie type:</b>
<br>
Those individuals wanting to create complex movies beyond the 
simple built-in movie types will want to use the "user-defined"
movie type.  This movie type depends on a user-provided procedure
to perform the appropriate view and trajectory frame updates when
each movie frame is rendered.  The user-defined procedure is triggered
when a special variable is set during the rendering process, by virtue
of the Tcl "trace" feature.  The user-defined procedure must be enabled
to trace the ::MovieMaker::userframe variable before the movie generation
process has started.  A simple example implementation using 3 procedures
is included below.  In actual use, one would source the example script
below, then issue the <b>enablemoviecallback</b> routine, set the movie
type to "User Defined Procedure", and start the movie generation process
by pressing the "Make Movie" button.  The user-defined movie frame procedure
can be disabled with the example <b>disablemoviecallback</b> procedure.

<p>
Simplest version of a <a href="usermovie.tcl">user-defined movie script</a>.

<p>
A <a href="usermoviefade.tcl">more complete example that includes a fade-in</a>
on a transparent material. Follow the instructions at the top of the 
script to try it out.

<p>
<b>"Userani" movie system:</b>
<br>
Based on the trace method mentioned above, an easy-to-use automatic        
animation system 
<a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/script_library/scripts/userani/">Userani</a> 
for the Movie Maker has been            
created, using a simple storyboard fashion. It offers an easy way to define     
a timeline of the loaded trajectory, to which various animation procedures      
can be added, as well as any VMD Tcl commands. This arrangement of the          
timeline can also be visualized and unlimited parallel or overlapping           
actions are available. There's no need to care about traces, frames and         
frame ranges and a lot of animations are already prepared, including:
<ul>
<li>Animated Auto-Zoom
<li>Animated Auto-Center
<li>Material Transparency Fading
<li>Material Property Fading
<li>Rotations real and graphically
</ul>

<p>
<b>Software antialiasing post-processing:</b>
<br>
The use of antialiasing can greatly improve the quality of the final
movie as it will reduce artifacts that generally decrease the effectiveness
of the back-end compression algorithms in MPEG, AVI and other movie formats.
To use software-based post processing on machines or renderers that lack 
built-in antialising, check the "smoothing" button, then enable the 
half-size rescale button and make your VMD window twice the size 
(on both axes) that you want the final movie to be.  Once this
is done, you may render the movie.

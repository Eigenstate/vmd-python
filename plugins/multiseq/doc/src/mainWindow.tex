\section{The MultiSeq Graphical Environment}
MultiSeq is accessed as an extension within VMD.  To begin MultiSeq,
launch VMD and:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the VMD main window, click on the \textsf{Extensions} Menu.
\item In Extensions, select \textsf{Analysis} $\rightarrow$
\textsf{MultiSeq}.
\end{enumerate}
(alternatively, if you are a fan of command lines, you can type
`\texttt{multiseq}' into the VMD terminal window)

The main MultiSeq window (see Fig.~\ref{fig:main}) will appear (note
that the first time you run MultiSeq, you will be prompted to download
necessary databases before seeing the main window).

%\subsection{MultiSeq Window Shortcuts}
%The main MultiSeq window has several shortcuts that provide complementary information with 
%additional functionality for the analysis of alignments.  For the purposes of examining these shortcuts, we will 
%use several structure and sequence files of the catalytic domain of AARSs.  
% The image with shortcut indicators will be around here

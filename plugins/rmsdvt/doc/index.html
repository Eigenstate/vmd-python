<h3><a name="description">Description</a></h3>

<p>
RMSD Visualizer Tool -plugin is an extension for <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>. Its main functions include
aligning molecules and calculating and visualizing RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)
and RMSF (Root Means Square Fluctuation) data through trajectories.
</p><p>
Plotting the calculated RMSD 2D data is available by using a separate 'Multiplot' plugin (included with <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>).<br>
Plotting the calculated RMSD 3D data is available by using a separate 'Heatmapper' plugin
(see <a href="#download">Download and Install</a> below).
</p>




<h3><a name="usage">Usage Instructions</a></h3>

<img src="rmsdvt1.0_ui.jpg">

<h4>Molecule: <span class="imgref">2</span></h4>
<p>
All the operations are performed on the selected molecule. The refresh button can be used
to update the list of available molecules, for example when molecule trajectories have 
changed and the list is not updated automatically.
</p>

<h4>Atom Selection: <span class="imgref">3</span></h4>
<p>
The Atom Selection text box is used to specify the atoms that are used in the <i>Align</i><span class="imgref">8</span>
and <i>RMSD</i><span class="imgref">7</span> operations. The Atom Selection text box accepts the same inputs as the VMD
Graphical representations Selected Atoms text input.
</p>
<h4>Atom selection modifiers: <span class="imgref">4</span></h4>
<p>
The Atom Selection Modifiers are provided as a convenience, the same effects can be
achieved by using only the Atom Selection clause<span class="imgref">3</span>. <i>'Backbone'</i> selects only atoms of 
the protein backbone. <i>'Trace'</i> selects only the alpha carbon atoms of the backbone. 
<i>'noH'</i> leaves out all hydrogen atoms from the selection.
</p>

<h4>Trajectory: <span class="imgref">5</span></h4>
<p>
The affected trajectory frames can be selected by checking the Frames and Step size
checboxes in the Trajectory options. These selections affect both <i>Align</i><span class="imgref">8</span> and
<i>RMSD</i><span class="imgref">7</span> operations.
</p>

<h4>Reference: <span class="imgref">6</span></h4>
<p>
In RMSD calculations the atom positions used as the reference for the calculation
are specified using the Reference Molecule ID and Frame. Using the <i>Window</i>
selection instead of <i>Frame</i> moves the reference frame along with the
calculation frame. For example, using a <i>Window</i> of 5 would use frame 1 of the
reference molecule as the reference for the atom locations in selected molecules
frame 6. For the first 5 frames of the calculation the reference frame will be frame 0.
</p><p>
Note: If frames are limited from entire range,  reference frame can still be taken
from outside specified limited range. For example, using RMSF (windowed) mode with a 
window of 8, in frame 10, the reference frame of the selected reference molecule will
be 2, even if the trajectory frames were specified to be from 10-20. 
</p>

<h4>Alignment: <span class="imgref">7</span></h4>
<p>
Alignment is done using the atoms specified by the Atom Selection clause<span class="imgref">3</span> in the Atom
Selection text box. Even though only the selected atoms are used in the calculations
for finding the alignment, all the atoms of the selected molecule will be moved according
to the new alignment. Alignment is always done through a specified trajectory using a
reference molecule and its specified frame (or frame window). Selected molecule will be superimposed on 
the selected Reference molecule<span class="imgref">6</span>. The alignment is done according to the <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/vmd-1.7.1/ug/node185.html">VMD
guidelines</a> for computing the alignment.
</p><p>
Selecting 'self' as the reference 'Molecule ID' will align the molecule with itself through
the specified trajectory. Selecting another molecule's ID as the reference 'Molecule ID'<span class="imgref">6</span> will
align the molecule with the selected reference molecule and its frame, so that it will be
superimposed on the reference molecule. 
</p><p>
<u>Note:</u> When doing an alignment using another
molecule as the reference, the selections for both molecules need to have the exact same number
of atoms. It is not possible to use a separate Atom Selection clauses<span class="imgref">3</span> for the two
molecules involved in this kind of an alignment. Caution should be especially used when the residue numberings
differ between the reference molecule and the aligned (superimposed) molecule.
</p>
<h4>RMSD: <span class="imgref">8</span></h4>
<p>
RMSD calculations are done for the selected molecule<span class="imgref">2</span>, through the selected frames<span class="imgref">5</span>, using a
selected molecule and a frame<span class="imgref">6</span> (or a frame window) as a reference point. The results of the
calculation will appear in the results list, where they can be selected and plotted in either
2D or 3D graphs (See <i>Plotting</i> below). The RMSD calculations are done according to the <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/vmd-1.7.1/ug/node185.html">VMD
guidelines</a>.
</p>

<h4>Plotting: <span class="imgref">9,</span><span class="imgref">10,</span><span class="imgref">11</span></h4>
<p>
The results list shows information about the done RMSD calculations. To plot RMSD results, 
select a row in the Results list. The results are stored as long as the item (row) is not 
removed from the list. The selected results can be plotted as 2D graphs (multiple results
can be selected and plotted in one graph) using Multiplot, or as 3D heatmap graphs using
the Heatmapper-plugin.
</p><p>
Using the heatmap plot function, further RMSD calculations are done based on the selected
Heatmap plot mode (in the Options menu<span class="imgref">1</span>). The default functionality is to calculate RMSD 
separately for each residue that includes any selected atoms (selected by Atom Selection<span class="imgref">3</span>). 
For example, using the selection 'Plot all backbones in atom selection (resid)', a series of RMSD calculations are made
individually for each residue's backbone atoms and its reference residue's backbones atoms. Every RMSD calculation will
represent a single data point in the heatmap. 
</p><p>
<b>It is imporant to note that the heatmap RMSD calculations are done for all the residues that include an atom selected by
the atom selection clause</b><span class="imgref">3</span>. For example, by selecting only alpha carbon atoms with the
atom selection clause<span class="imgref">3</span>, still the complete residues including all their atoms will be used in the heatmap calculations. 
If you wish to use only the alpha carbons in the heatmap calculations, select either:
</p><p>
<i>'Options<span class="imgref">1</span> -> Backbone def... -> CA only'</i>
<br>and
<br><i>'Options<span class="imgref">1</span> -> Heatmap plot... -> Plot resid backbone atoms in atom selection'</i><br> 
</p><p>
or alternatively use:<br></i>'Options<span class="imgref">1</span> -> Heatmap plot... -> Plot every atom in atom selection'</i>
</p><p>
which will plot and use <i>only</i> the atoms selected with the atom selection clause<span class="imgref">3</span>.
</p><p>
It is also possible to save calculated heatmap data into a file or to change the plotted heatmaps axis labels through
the <i>Results -> Heatmap...</i> menu.
</p><p>
Note: No matter what the selected Heatmap Plot mode is, the calculations are always done
internally using "residue" numbering (not "resid") to avoid duplicate resid numberings affecting
the calculation. "Residue" numberings are unique IDs used and assigned by VMD, where "resid" 
numberings are not quaranteed to be unique, as they are read in from the molecule structure 
files (PDB).
</p><p>
Note: Results can be replotted as long as they are present in the results list. Changing the
Heatmap plot mode and replotting a heatmap for a result will cause the heatmap data to be 
recalculated.

<!--#set var="TITLE" value="Automatic Atom Typing Plugin (IDATM), Version 1.0"-->
<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

IDATM provides a method for automatically typing atoms in a molecule based on geometric information. When run, it can apply atom types and, in combination with molefacture, properly add hydrogens when necessary. IDATM is based on the algorithm presented by Meng and Lewis (JCC 12(7):891-898), with a few minor modifications.

<h3>Usage</h3>

IDATM can be used directly from the command line, or accessed through the Molefacture GUI. To use IDATM from the command line, use the commands

<pre>
  package require IDATM
  runtyping SELECTION
</pre>

Where SELECTION is the selection to be typed. Proper atoms types will be applied, and proper bond orders set, for all atoms in SELECTION.

By default, IDATM uses the atom types listed below. The builtin type names can be overloaded with the command

<pre>
  read_idatm_types FILE
</pre>

Here FILE contains a set of type definitions, one per line, where the first entry is the builtin IDATM name for a type, and the second entry is the new type name. For example, to type all IDATM C3 atoms as C.3 (useful, for example, for SYBYL-compatible mol2 files), one would use a file including the line

<pre>
  C3 C.3
</pre>

A sample conversion file to map between IDATM types and SYBIL types is shown <a href="mol2.idatm.in">here</a>.

<h3>Builtin atom types</h3>

The following atom type definitions are included in IDATM (mostly taken from Meng and Lewis, 1991):

<pre>
    C3 - sp3 carbon
    C2 - sp2 carbon
    C1 - sp carbon
    Cac - carboxylate carbon
    N3p - Quaternary amine nitrogen
    N3 - Uncharged sp3 nitrogen
    Npl - sp2 nitrogen
    N1 - sp nitrogen
    Nox - Nitrogen bound to oxygen
    Ntr - NO2 nitrogen
    Ngp - guanidinium nitrogen
    O3 - sp3 oxygen
    O2 - sp2 oxygen
    Om - carboxylate or nitro oxygen
    S3p - Positively charged sulfur
    S3 - sp3 sulfur
    S2 - sp2 sulfur
    Sac - Sulfate sulfur
    Sox - Sulfoxide sulfur
    S - Generic sulfur
    Bac - Borate boron
    Box  - Oxidized boron
    B - Boron
    Pac - Phosphate phosphorus
    Pox - P-oxide phosphorus
    P3p - Positively charged sp3 phosphorus
    P - Other phosphorus
    HC - Hydrogen bonded to carbon
    H - Other hydrogen
    DC - Deuterium bonded to carbon
    D - Other deuterium
